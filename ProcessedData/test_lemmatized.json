from community college this past spring and have since became single and moved into university forms and started un this past monday","my issue is i am scared to approach women and ask about a potential date even when it looks like i have a chance","i will give some scenario that apply to me","tuesday i saw a very attractive women who appeared lost","i went up to her and asked if she was lost to which she said yes","she was looking for x location to stop and get coffee and then needed to find x location to get to her class","i told her i would help her find the places since i more or less know the camps from visiting here over the summer","i took her to where the coffee shop was on camps and they were closed so we moved on to a separate building to head towards her class","now all this time we introduced each other and had a very nice discussion","i was on na mention something about maybe asking if she wanted to get coffee something as friends since she could not get any that day as they were closed","well my lack of confidence in my looks and in relationships made me chicken out and not ask anything","now fast forward to today and i headed to the fitness center on camps with a roommate to play king long","there was two people playing there already a male and a female","there was no spare king long balls left so i asked if they had an extra or a quarter i could use to get an extra","the women ended up having four quarters and i gave her a dollar to make it fair and i got an extra king long","during all this time we ended up chatting and since my friend and i had only learned last weekend how to play they both decided to teach one of us how to play","so we took turns at first i learned from the guy then i learned a bit from the women then some more from the guy","now i am not sure if they were dating or even friends even though they seemed like friends","i kind of wanted to ask her for her number and or snapchat to maybe play again sometime to get better at the game and maybe even hang out with her more but once again when she left i thickened out thinking i do not wan na seem weird or like i am trying to get something or maybe that is her boyfriend and act act and just generally wiped out again","basically i am scared to even try to approach women mostly and when i do i cannot bring myself to ask for a snapchat or phone number because the last time i did was in the spring and it did not go over well","i am scared of rejection or looking like a creep","i wan na be able to overcome that or just generally have tips that actually would help","i know i sound like a whence and probably am but i am trying to actually come out and be more social","if it helps i tend to be more reserved and

describing things to him","i just do not think my story is a compelling enough for a book or b long enough to fill a book also c i do not want to write a book but i will give you guns the story as i remember it","i first became sick in december of two thousand and twelve","what we thought was probably step throat eventually turned in to months of shortness of breath which was originally diagnosed as bronchitis","i went to my local hospital s e care facility in january complaining of shortness of breath and racing heart","now when i say shortness of breath i am talking panting by the time i got to the end of the hall or to the teacher s lounge at school","this was bad stuff","i told two nurses about my breathing but neither apparently thought it important to put on my chart for the doctor","the doctor came in and checked me over and was about to release me when i brought up my shortness of breath","she was surprised by this and decided to send me for x rays","they came back clear and i was sent home with a bronchitis diagnosis a nebulizer an inhaled an antibiotic and a prescription for tamiflu","i was very diligent about taking my medicine and using my inhaled however i

had me sit up and hold a bar above my head for the x ray","it was at that time that it occurred to me that i would likely not survive the night","the pain was blinding","then i was pushed back on the stretcher","i remember the young nurse asking where the older nurse was taking me","i am taking her to it the older nurse replied","we do not have orders for that","you are going to take her to it without orders","the young nurse was incredulously","she is very sick was the only reply","it felt like and angel and a demon were fighting for my soul","my memory starts to get fully here","the next thing i remember is being on a bed in it they told me to hold my breath which was nearly impossible at this point","i was very quickly rushed in to another room at this point","the pain was unbearable","the er doctor dr t was suddenly covering over me with a flurry of frantic nurses running around the room all around me","dr t s eyes were so sad and fearful","he began stroking my hair and face and explaining that they found a really big blood clot in my lungs and that i had smaller clots in my lungs and left leg","he explained that they needed my permission to use clot masters to try to break up the clot but that it is dangerous and i could bleed in my brain","dread enveloped me like a thick oppressive blanket","i could not breathe to speak i was incredibly hot and the pain was phenomena","it felt like every bone in my body was being crushed to powder","i was willing to try anything to stop the pain so i nodded yes","let the record show that the patient has given non

pushing them out to the universe","at some point a serious doctor came in just sit across from me and watch me","he tried asking me some questions but i could not really answer","then the pain just stopped","it just stopped and i was glorious fantastically cold","i woke up fully to my husband still by my side and my mother in law and father in law at my feet","i was super thirsty and just utterly euphoric that i was alive","dr t came back in eyes almost tears and congratulated me on making it","he explained that someone would wheel me to an upper floor in a few minutes","then met sessile came in a bit later because she wanted to check up on me","she also congratulated me on being alive","the rest of the story involves lots of poking and testing six months of blood thinner scar tissue in my leg and living in whatever ways i can","my blood clot turns out to be unexplained","they are not sure what caused it but birth control may have been a factor","i met a friend on credit who went through the same thing shortly after me and we founded clotsurvivors together to help people like us","i thanked those people who saved my life that night with letters and golden heart pins but how do you really properly thank someone for saving you like that","i owe those people my life","had events not unfolded exactly as they had i would be dead and you would not be reading my long

infrastructure to european cities","also many small european towns have the same bicycle infrastructure problem as many american cities","berlin is notorious for having a cap bicycle infrastructure","food in america is a personal choice you have more possibility to make bad decisions","it turns out that making bad decisions is also cheaper and easier and making healthy ones are expensive and require education","he clearly has no idea how to buy healthy food he did choose to stop at a deny s instead of venturing into a small town and stopping at a local restaurant a prime example of him choosing the lazy cheap way that was not available to him in poland","in the us you need to learn to actually look at what is in your food to make good decisions in europe you can buy almost anything and it is mostly safe","although that is changing i am finding more and more cap processes foods on the shelves and the people here are just as prepared for it","already germany believe their tiny one room corner store baker is some how making twenty different types of bread every morning on their own","so utf is his point with the land","seems like he just needs to move to a rural location","there are many parts of the us where you will never see your neighbors","also one of the things i hate about germany is that the lakes are all privately owned","there is literally fences around entire lakes that are illegal to cross and most the only access is if you pay a private organization to use it","as a minnesota born american where there is a law that every lake must have a section which is public free access i find this incredibly disturbing","most germans do not own aches which is a slaves word the german word is schrebergarten or kleingartenanlage","they are also almost always fenced in","in my home of minnesota it is traditional to own a lake cabin to visit like europeans visit their garden houses as it is in many other states too","just another example of the writer s total ignorance of the us","it is like if someone grew up in the industrial area of frankfort and never gathered to see much outside of that then went to rural montana they would be saying these same things","people are spending their time in nature","they actually grow their own vegetables and hunt their own meat","there are not roads and factories every where","the local small town does not have any chain stores or restaurant"],"document_tokenized":[["there","are","many","reasons","not","to","live","in","the","us","but","having","infrastructure","and","personal","food","choice","seem","to","be","pretty","dumb","ones","and","the","last","point","does","not","even","make","sense"],["in","my","opinion","the","writer","is","also","joyfully","ignorant","of","the","us","no","surprise","and","europe"],["roads","he","goes","to","complain","about","how","there","are","too","many","roads","in","the","us","and","then","shows","maps","of","columbia","a","developing","nation","and","two","other","non","american","urban","cities","with","just","as","many","roads"],["roads","create","economic","growth","if","those","poor","countries","without","roads","could","build","them","they","would"],["as","far","as","bike","friendly","goes","he","then","uses","an","american","city","as","an","example","of","doing","something","good"],["does","not","this","just","mean","he","would","love","living","in","minneapolis"],["poland","seattle","austin","pick","a","youth","magnet","city","and","they","have","comparable","bicycling","infrastructure","to","european","cities"],["also","many","small","european","towns","have","the","same","bicycle","infrastructure","problem","as","many","american","cities"],["berlin","is","notorious","for","having","a","cap","bicycle","infrastructure"],["food","in","america","is","a","personal","choice","you","have","more","possibility","to","make","bad","decisions"],["it","turns","out","that","making","bad","decisions","is","also","cheaper","and","easier","and","making","healthy","ones","are","expensive","and","require","education"],["he","clearly","has","no","idea","how","to","buy","healthy","food","he","did","choose","to","stop","at","a","deny","s","instead","of","venturing","into","a","small","town","and","stopping","at","a","local","restaurant","a","prime","example","of","him","choosing","the","lazy","cheap","way","that","was","not","available","to","him","in","poland"],["in","the","us","you","need","to","learn","to","actually","look","at","what","is","in","your","food","to","make","good","decisions","in","europe","you","can","buy","almost","anything","and","it","is","mostly","safe"],["although","that","is","changing","i","am","finding","more","and","more","cap","processes","foods","on","the","shelves","and","the","people","here","are","just","as","prepared","for","it"],["already","germany","believe","their","tiny","one","room","corner","store","baker","is","some","how","making","twenty","different","types","of","bread","every","morning","on","their","own"],["so","utf","is","his","point","with","the","land"],["seems","like","he","just","needs","to","move","to","a","rural","location"],["there","are","many","parts","of","the","us","where","you","will","never","see","your","neighbors"],["also","one","of","the","things","i","hate","about","germany","is","that","the","lakes","are","all","privately","owned"],["there","is","literally","fences","around","entire","lakes","that","are","illegal","to","cross","and","most","the","only","access","is","if","you","pay","a","private","organization","to","use","it"],["as","a","minnesota","born","american","where","there","is","a","law","that","every","lake","must","have","a","section","which","is","public","free","access","i","find","this","incredibly","disturbing"],["most","germans","do","not","own","aches","which","is","a","slaves","word","the","german","word","is","schrebergarten","or","kleingartenanlage"],["they","are","also","almost","always","fenced","in"],["in","my","home","of","minnesota","it","is","traditional","to","own","a","lake","cabin","to","visit","like","europeans","visit","their","garden","houses","as","it","is","in","many","other","states","too"],["just","another","example","of","the","writer","s","total","ignorance","of","the","us"],["it","is","like","if","someone","grew","up","in","the","industrial","area","of","frankfort","and","never","gathered","to","see","much","outside","of","that","then","went","to","rural","montana","they","would","be","saying","these","same","things"],["people","are","spending","their","time","in","nature"],["they","actually","grow","their","own","vegetables","and","hunt","their","own","meat"],["there","are","not","roads","and","factories","every","where"],["the","local","small","town","does","not","have","any","chain","stores","or","restaurant"]],"document_stopwords":[["many","reasons","live","us","infrastructure","personal","food","choice","seem","pretty","dumb","ones","last","point","even","make","sense"],["opinion","writer","also","joyfully","ignorant","us","surprise","europe"],["roads","goes","complain","many","roads","us","shows","maps","columbia","developing","nation","two","non","american","urban","cities","many","roads"],["roads","create","economic","growth","poor","countries","without","roads","could","build","would"],["far","bike","friendly","goes","uses","american","city","example","something","good"],["mean","would","love","liv

the seasons end ."," the blood and effects had been toned down , the nudity and sex had been toned down , and the writing had suddenly become excellent , to where the season 1 finale was an absolutely incredible explosion of all of the previously twisted , built up plotlines throughout the season ."," i have screamed ' holy shit ' at my tv more times while watching spartacus than i have watching any movies or other shows , and this is counting the wire , lost , dexter , the sopranos , mad men , the last airbender , and even though i hate to say it : more than breaking bad or game of thrones

gritty and at times deliberately over-the-top pure adrenaline fun ."," the battle scenes got better and better until they became head over shoulders better than game of thrones ."," the show finally

paced and well - shot nod to 300 and other sword - and - sandal movies ."," some actual serious issues and questions and emotion are delved into , and not clumsily either ."," there 's still a fair amount of relatively gratuitous nudity , but it 's more on part of game of thrones in that area , although it is n't hypocritical by only having females in nude scenes ."," and then there 's this
