{"id":"train-TLDR_RS_2017-08-9442.json","document":["about a week ago i gave in and bought an m870 gas shotgun , and yesterday i got to use it for the day ."," so i thought i 'd right a review of my experience so far , and give a little advice for buying a shotgun ."," the shotgun style of gameplay is between pistols and aegs ."," you have to move constantly to get in range and be aggressive , or be sneaky and wait for the enemy to walk right past you ."," using a shotgun keeps my mind going , and stops me from peeking around cover shooting people at max range , which i often find myself doing with an aeg or sniper and end up getting a bit bored ."," if you want more adrenaline from your game days , get a shotgun and push yourself ."," so first off a bit of background ."," a few months ago i bought a cyma springer clone for about  50 ."," it quickly became my main primary ( i 'll talk a bit more about it later , i fell in love with the trishot game - play style and started brooding over a gas shotgun ."," so i got to some research on the tm range and settled on the m870 tactical ."," almost every forum post i read complained about leaking ."," some people got angry and gave up , some did hpa conversion ."," my site does n't allow hpa , and i like to keep a light loadout , so a gas tank on my back is a no - no ."," after i did some more reading i found that the two culprits are the gas tank and the expansion chamber ."," being made by tm , i assumed these leaks were just down to o - rings drying out while the guns sit on shelves , and owners not properly taking care of them ."," so i went to my local shop and took the plunge ."," it 's a great store and they always test the guns before handing them over ."," sure enough the gas tank in the box leaked so the guy tried another ."," on the third attempt we got one that did n't leak ."," i got it home , filled it up and could hear a leak from inside the gun ."," was n't surprised , was n't angry , expected as much ."," cue youtube videos and 2 hours of disassembly ( this thing has a lot of parts ) ."," sure enough the o - rings were dry as hell ."," greased everything that needed it , added some ptfe tape in places for good measure , reassembled and leak fixed !"," the take away from this is do n't consider this gun unless you are willing to put time in and are confident in working on gas guns ."," so with that said , lets get to the actual review ."," receiver and barrels are metal , the pump and stock are a sturdy plastic ."," being a tm the gun feels very solid and has good weight ."," an absolute dream to hold and shoot , as should be expected from marui ."," gas tank - the m870 has a big gas tank that slots into the stock ."," you can buy extra tanks , but for now i just refill the original ."," in the first game of the day the gun went flat after two shells , bummer ."," turns out this was due to the gas ."," because of fps laws in japan , the gun was designed to use low pressure gas ."," when filled with lower pressure gas the tank lasted 9 shells ( 90 shots on 3 - shot ) which is more than i ever use in a game , so all good ."," the gun takes standard 30 bb shells ."," when i first tried it i used my standard bbs and nuprol branded shells i use in my springer ."," about half the shots would blank fire , but the genuine tm shell fired perfectly ."," so sadly i had to buy some proper tm shells at  15 for a 2 - pack ."," i was also told in the shop that these guns are very sensitive to the type of bb , so i 've taken the precaution of using tm 's perfect hit bbs ( do n't use many with a shotgun so not worried about the cost ."," other brands of bbs can jam when using 6 - shot , and if you force the pump forward you can chip the nozzles ."," the gun has a shell release near the trigger which opens a door on the bottom and lightly pushes the shell out ."," i have a dump pouch on my front to drop them into , so reload time is really quick , limited only by the time taken to grab a new shell and put it in ."," the best thing about the gun ."," no more forcing springs and spongy clicks , cocking this thing feels like a mini orgasm ( phrasing ? )"," you can shot very rapidly and slam fire if you desire , though a slower pull is recommended for 6 - shot ."," not as far as an aeg , but decent ."," shotguns are n't designed for range , but this one 's is decent ."," good spread from the bbs so do n't bother aiming ."," the hop - up is a bit weak , even using 0.20 s as recommended by tm ."," i did find on a second tare - down that the buckings were a bit dirty , might have gone overboard on the grease ."," clean those up and added a few layers of tape to the top to push them down , have n't tested this yet but it still shoots at 300 fps ."," at first i was a bit sad that i had to use .20 s , as i use .28 s in my springer and can decimate people in bushes ."," this turned out not to be an issue , as accuracy at range is n't really the point and the 3 shots made up for it ."," i actually quite like them now because they travel to the target so much quicker than higher weights with the same energy ."," the coolest but probably most pointless feature ."," there is a small selector behind the ejection cover on the side ."," you can choose between 3 bbs per shot or 6 ."," the 6 shot mode simply loads 2 bbs into each barrel instead of 1 ."," i will admit that 6 shot is extremely fun , but you only get 5 shots per 30 bb shell , and fewer shells per tank ."," i 'll be sticking with 3 for now , but it 's nice to have it there ."," overall i 'm very happy , but a few kinks to work out still ."," now to compare it to my cheap shotgun and give some general advice on buying shotguns ."," so when i decided to try gaming with a shotgun , i went for a springer first ."," the cyma m870s are clones of the tm springers , and normally cost about  50 ."," i loved it from the start and soon got used to the heavy pull of the pump ."," it has a fixed hop which works best with .28 or .30 g bbs ."," these tare through vegetation , and people definitely know when they get hit ."," if you are thinking of trying out shotguns , i suggest borrowing a friends or getting a cheap tri-shot springer before going the full hog with the tm gas models ."," if you ca n't have a fun game and get kills ( to start with you will kill fewer people than with an aeg until you get used to the more berserker style of play ) with a springer , then a gas model probably is n't worth the money ."," with that said , having gas powered shots is amazing , and i definitely recommend it as a next step if you are willing to put in the work taking care of it ."," i will probably still run my springer from time to time due to the fun i 've had with it , and i have n't seen

things i had literally 0 experience ."," i was too scared of failure and rejection to push my emotions and tell her straight up ."," we flirted so much and looking back , i should 've pulled the

and although we had a lot of issues talking because of other people trying to hold us back from each other , we got back to what seemed like normal ."," i had my best friend back , someone i could talk to daily about everything and anything , who would comfort me when i fell , and who i would comfort when she felt down ."," eventually , this refreshed friendship really pushed the boundaries of what we could call friendship ."," after one alcohol - involved night and many days of flirting and a few dates , we ended up making out in front of my house ( this was my first kiss as well ; in retrospect this was probably both really good in the sense that i finally got to kiss the love of my life , but really bad because you 'll find out later . )"," this really grayed up our friendship ,

the blue , she just ignored me and it went on like that for about a month ."," i messaged her once , but not wanting to bother her \/ look clingy , i gave her her space ."," eventually she returned

off on a journey much longer than the actual drug is in their system ."," or because you were never on a high enough dose to be therapeutic , there are a variety of reasons why you might have continued to experience symptoms regardless of the medication ."," it 's also quite normal with all antipsychotics to experience extremely vivid and often surreal dreams ."," i ca n't think of any atypical or old school antipsychotic that has n't done that to me , you can place that firmly in the side effects category and not worry about it at least ."," once you have psychosis it 's much harder to get out from under it than it is to induce it , further once you have had it , you become far more likely to experience the symptoms again ."," it 's worth noting here also that topamax can cause hallucinations , so you need to discredit that as having psychotic symptoms outside of a mood state if that 's the only time it 's happened ."," i 'm under express orders from my psychiatrist to stop taking it whenever i start to hallucinate ."," they can never quite decide whether i 'm bp 1 with psychotic features or schizoaffective either ."," as i 'm sure you know the rule of thumb is if you do n't have psychotic symptoms outside of a mood episode , you 're not schizoaffective , but it 's a very fuzzy rule , who 's to say where one episode ends and the next begins ?"," for me it 's not very clean cut at all , i have n't been outside of a mood episode in at least a decade i cycle constantly , meds just turn down the volume ."," which is why i get to keep my nifty bipolar diagnosis ."," there is no way to make that determination for me and when it might have been possible to do so , i was very young ."," i 've been diagnosed since i was 14 and with clinical depression a year before that ."," i 'll be 35 in april ."," so 20 years give or take that i 've been living with this ."," either illness would n't have progressed so far when i was 14 that i 'd have the sorts of hallucinations i have now so it 's difficult to say ."," i remember having lots of auditory hallucinations back then , including while taking risperdal , for me they just kept upping the dose until they stopped , which has certainly wreaked a havoc on my body that has been life long , but it 's impossible to say what it specifically did to my brain because of all the other meds i 've taken over the last 20 years ."," i can tell you that i had no significant uptick in hallucinations following it 's cessation ."," do n't worry about diagnosis though , bp1 is ok and will get you where you need to be , in psychiatry perfect diagnosis is less important than treating symptoms ."," this is because there are no definitive diagnoses in psychiatry , there are no real medical tests that can pin point with any accuracy what you have ."," psychiatrists are doing it old school , it 's the same way everything used to be diagnosed , listen to the patient 's subjective evaluation of their condition , observe objectively the patient , gather any other data available and make a diagnosis based upon what you now know using diagnostic criteria ."," if you have n't given it a go already try lithium it 's totally worth the bloodwork if it works for you ."," it 's been the only thing that mostly keeps my psychotic symptoms at bay ."," i refuse to take daily antipsychotics that i do n't need daily , but i do have two different prescriptions for older non atypical antipsychotics on hand to take prn if the world starts to get weird or i stop being able to sleep ."," older drugs because i wo n't take the new ones and also because they tend to kick in faster so they make more sense as a prn ."," the only big advantage to the newer drugs anyways is they 're slightly less likely to give you tardive dyskinesia which is not a problem if you only take them short term ."," there are a lot of ways to treat what we have , but the biggest problem we all face is lazy psychiatrists who ca n't think outside the box and give up on us ."," the best quality for a psychiatrist to possess is perfectionism ."," you just keep hammering away until you start to get better and then you keep going ."," demand a better life and do n't stop until you 've got it ."," my meds are constantly tweaked at least every couple of months , i would n't be doing this well ( which could definitely be better ) , if i did n't demand that every option be on the table that we be willing to try novel things , that i could max out on the doses of certain meds , that i could take an antipsychotic prn and not everyday ."," i made a lot of those decisions myself by dictating what i was and was n't willing to live with when it came to side effects , and how i felt in general ."," it 's your body , it 's your right to tell any doctor , you can write that prescription but i wo n't fill it so it would probably be better to find something i am willing to fill ."," if you do n't want to take an antipsychotic make them try everything else first , then reevaluate your position ."," i put my foot down about it and i think it 's one of the best decisions that i ever made ."," i would n't give up those prn antipsychotic prescriptions for anything though , i recognize the necessity ."," i created a solution with a lesser evil and that 's as good as it usually gets ."],"summary":"it 's more likely you set

off the face of the planet ."," * however , that is n't what riot is doing ."," this is what riot is doing :"," recipe : serrated dirk + b.f. sword + ???"," gold ( over 3000 gold total , still fine tuning )"," unique passive : +10 armor penetration"," unique passive : basic attacks on an enemy champion apply nightfall ( 60 second cooldown ) ."," nightfall : after 2 seconds , deal 25 % of the target s missing health as physical damage ."," if the target dies before nightfall ends , the cooldown is refunded ."," this wo n't work ."," firstly , the item is * fine * for lane assassins ."," they can buy a dirk or bf sword depending on what they back with first back and can go out and be just as strong as they are now ."," however , once they complete this item , if they 're snowballing , * this item will give them the tool they need to take out tankier enemies ."," * this means oppresive and stompy ."," it does help keep assassins who are out of the game claw back in ."," however , the main issue : * this wo n't help kha ' zix ."," it 's a lane item , and lane kha ' zix has many issues that gravitate with his kit ."," he belongs in the jungle , and as a jungler * he is bound to getting warrior first ."," this means this item will come at a time where it 's too late ."," he 's either already snowballed to heaven or has become nothing but a liability ."," this item as a second item will help his damage output be * slightly * better against tankier champs , but * it wo n't help him snowball * , which is what kha ' zix or ad assassins as a whole strive to do ."," ** 4 - okay , so we know ad assassins besides kha ' zix are fine and we know this item wo n't help him ."," you have two options to fix kha ' zix and his lack of power right now ."," either buff warrior , or mini-rework kha ' zix ."," now , if you buff warrior ( or caulfield 's ) , you end up putting people like rengar , lee sin , etc. who are already doing just fine even further ahead ."," this change will help kha ' zix , but will also rocket these other , strong , warrior junglers into god - like duelists at lvl 6 - 9 who 'll just 1 - shot anyone they want ."," not a viable option ."," so that brings us to our second option : * mini-rework kha ' zix ."," * what 's wrong with kha ' zix ?"," how do we fix him ?"," he has the following problems :"," - low damage , * especially * if enemy is not isolated ."," - no escape tools if he ca n't kill his target or something nearby ."," - rubber - bandy isolation mechanic ."," * what is his identity ?"," grasshopper assassin who assassinates isolated targets with a low cd ability while hopping around like nuts ."," that 's his lategame fantasy ."," mass slaughter of isolated targets ."," * what 's a possible rework that may work ?"," here 's * my * idea ."," while my specific rework idea may be dumb or not work well , i * strongly * believe reworking kha ' zix specifically is the way to go ."," passive - unseen threat :"," - remove ap scaling entirely ."," - change slow to 50 % for 1 second ."," - change damage from 15 - 190 to 25 - 250 ."," q - taste their fear :"," - add a reverse spellblade passive effect ."," \" champions that kha ' zix auto - attacks get a \" fearful \" debuff that increases q damage by 25 % , regardless of isolation ."," only one target can be fearful at a time ."," q consumes this debuff ."," - change isolation mechanic to a gradient ."," \" instead of champions being either 100 % isolated at 425 range from an ally or 0 % isolated at any range below that , change it to a gradient where it is 0 - 100 % of 0 - 30 % depending on the range ."," so for example , champs isolated from 425 range from allies get 30 % increased q damage ."," those at 212.5 range from allies get 15 % increased q damage , etc. \""," - q cd resets on kill ."," w - void spike :"," - void spike projectiles are now pass - through ."," - void spike range decreased to 750 ."," - leap now operates off a charge system ."," up to 2 leaps can be saved up ."," cd remains the same ."," kills grant 1 leap charge ."," - once leap is used , it is put on a 3 - second static cooldown ."," this cooldown is negated if leap hits a enemy champion ."," r - void assault :"," - void assault now operates off a charge system ."," unevolved void assault can hold only 1 charge that refreshes every 40 seconds ."," evolved can hold 3 charges ."," cd is changed from 100 \/ 90\/80 to 40\/35\/30 ."," - movement speed bonus changed from 40 % to 50 % ."," ** 5 - so many charge systems !"," that 's his lategame fantasy though , hopping around and causing death , like a ad - single - target - katarina ."," he can do this already if he 's grossly ahead , but you really have to be obscenely ahead ."," these changes make him have higher , more reliable damage with access to escape mechanics if his assassination does n't work as well as better poke at closer range ."," ** 6 - so ."],"summary":"ad assassins are doing fine , kha ' zix

hours , so there was no question of turning back ."," we did some quick improvisation , basically tying me to my sister , who was still safely attached at the last anchor point ."," we had not brought

motherboard 's debug code would change from a0 ( a ok , everything good ) to 03 ."," i referenced the table of codes in my mobo 's manual and found no listing for an 03 code , so i assumed that it was referring to the next most visually similar option , d3 ."," in the manual and online , i found that the d3 code means that ' some architectural protocols are unavailable ' which is not a benign code like a0 is , but rather an actual legitimate issue ."," so i did a ton of research and found a handful of forums referring to d3 and also that it could have some relation to the code d4 ."," but all i could find was that half of people said d3 and d4 are just like a0 and not an issue at all , while the other half say it 's a critical issue that means you need to replace your cpu or motherboard ."," what i could not find was a single post or piece of information that was remotely definitive about what these codes conclusively mean ."," there was even a forum post from one guy who contacted gigabyte directly about it and even then , in their responses to him , they did not actually give any clear definition of the codes or their meanings ."," after hours of scouring the web i still could not discern whether or not my computer actually had a problem ."," the internet failed me , so i started doing some testing and experimenting of my own and i have finally , at long last , acquired the true and certain answer to this question : the codes d3 and d4 do not indicate a problem , because the codes do not contain d 's ."," if your motherboard 's 7 - segment led display looks like it 's showing d3 or d4 , it is in fact actually showing 03 or 04 , despite the fact that neither of those codes are listed in any manuals ( for whatever fucking reason ) ."," if your motherboard is throwing a d code of some sort , it will show a lowercase ' d' as in d3 or d4 ."," if your board is showing d3 or d4 ( or d anything really ) , then you do in fact have cause for concern ."," but with that now in mind , the codes 03 and 04 are just like a0 , completely harmless and not indicative of any issue whatsoever ."," they merely refer to the sleep state your computer was most recently woken from , 03 for waking from sleep and 04 for waking from hibernation ."," you can read more about sleep states here if you 're curious : https:\/\/docs.microsoft.com\/en-us\/windows\/win32\/power\/system-power-states"," i believe that these codes apply universally to almost all motherboards , not just those made by gigabyte ."," the codes appear to only occur on machines running windows and if it bothers you , it can potenially be changed by disabling ' fast boot ' in your computer 's advanced power settings ."," this did not work for me , but i read that it can in some cases ."," i realize that this is probably a noob question , and the reason that there is no information about it could just be because it 's something that most people just already know ."," but if you are a noob and you happen to run into this question , there is not a single conclusive answer to be found for it virtually anywhere on the internet or in a manual ."," so i am making this post in the hopes that this information will be accessible to anyone seeking it in the future , and they wo n't have to worry about it as much as i have xd .","

absolutely no effort by the user ."," by this , i mean if arm is going to stay , it should have a very limited range , making it a close - range anti-air asset for the maa driver who wants to move

the air vehicle \/ aa dynamic , they buffed aa assets immensely and nerfed the ever - loving shit out of the defensive capabilities of air vehicles ."," absurdly long cooldown on counters , more types of aa threats to manage , and no below radar = broken balancing dynamic ."," below radar was a genius and deep gameplay dynamic in its simplicity , rewarding skilled pilots by blocking a considerable portion of aa lock on types while adding the risk of being an easy target for rpgs and tanks , as well as being more prone to outright crashing into objects or the ground ."," bring it back with the

comment is all guesswork ."," non-historical actions of the son include his role in creation ( as jesus is the articulation of god in the world , the ' light ' of ' let there be light ' and all of those things are also articulations of god in the world ."," likewise , when louis - marie chauvet talks about christ , as best as i understand he is describing the articulation of all of creation working in harmony as it should , and was supposed , to be ."," as an undergraduate , i am not an authority , but those are how i take the use of the word historical to describe existence : that it is used to distinguish from abstract theological existence ."," to apply it to the resurrection , i think it would evoke the idea that jesus ' goodness can not be defeated by the world , and is persistant and strong through death just as in day - to - day life that people do good things and when they are defeated , ( and roundly defeated , not just for a bit like in the movies , whose happy endings i think are meant to evoke eternal life ) that they have still done the right thing ."," when i was younger , i would always search for solutions to movie type scenarios where the good guy would deceive people because they did n't understand and it was okay , because if they really understood they would n't do what they were doing ."," that is the kind of thinking that peter has when jesus calls him satan and asks peter to follow him instead ."," what i should have been realizing is that life in the world does n't work out as it should and that looking for ways to be ' successful ' was skewing my moral vision ."," i wo n't speak for bibs at all on your last question ."," after that i will speak very personally and say that there is a way in which i can say that i do n't believe in a literal resurrection , because it goes against everything i 've ever seen \/ all of the intuitions formed from my lived experiences ."," the way that i mean that is that if you say you believe something , if you 're pressed you wo n't give it up , and you wo n't be relieved when you are offered a plausible alternate explanation , you 're suprised and in denial ."," if i was sitting next to jesus and he explained why that 's in the bible in a way that i could understand , but did n't require me to think that if there was a streaming webcam in the tomb that it would look like jesus just all the sudden sitting up after being all the way dead and unwrapping his burial wrappings and leaving the tomb , i would be immensely relieved ."," as it stands right now , the way that i believe is that time and time again , i have been shown that maintaining some literal sense of scripture along with all of the allegorical \/ metaphoricals helps to understand it clearer , that as i go through theological texts my understandings of the allegorical \/ metaphoricals ( which are the ones whose value i understand ) are improved if i still read for a literal sense as well ."," speaking historically , it seems that christians like dante and thomas aquinas over a thousand years removed from jesus thought about things like \" the earliest jewish \/ pagan criticisms of christianity were n't that the resurrection was totally made up , but that followers stole him from the tomb \" meaning that the empty tomb was according to the evidence , a fact , and that the closest people to the event on all sides worked off of it ."," in addition things like \" if jesus did n't really rise , then why would people die for him \" , \" why would the religion spread so

characters , hm ?"," i ve never really understood why the inners get shafted  i suppose among the crew and fans in japan , they figured since sailor moon was the main character , ( although ikuhara , the director of r through ss , has stated mars was his favorite ) , she deserved to get the most attention by far ."," it bothers me too  why would they come up with these amazing , well thought out characters and limit them to the sidelines ?"," why not allow them plenty of time to shine , as well ?"," i do nt have the answer to this , but i will say one thing  count your blessings ."," in the manga , the only characters who get any respectable amount of development include usagi , chibiusa , and mamoru ."," everyone else is limited to their one - dimensional stereotype , although i personally feel haruka and ( to a lesser extent ) minako was treated a bit better , but only because usagi had a crush on haruka and because minako was arguably usagi s best friend ."," see what i m getting at ?"," the only way to get any characterization in the manga is through usagi , and one s relationship with her ."," which in itself is fine , i suppose , but it becomes quite annoying when the only thing you really know about the inners is their one basic trait group , like , say , ami being smart and liking computers and being lonely ."," things get better in the dream arc , slightly , as they re fleshed out a bit more , but every other arc has exactly one chapter * partially * devoted to each inner ."," hell , three of the inners in the black moon arc were missing for 70 % of the chapter ."," in that respect , the anime is almost perfection in comparison ."," they really made the others into more three - dimensional characters who had motivations and interests and goals outside of  we must protect usagi at all costs  , as they are in the manga ."," i do nt know how many times in the manga a character said that , in various wordings ."," i feel like part of the issue is the breakneck speed of the manga ."," there simply was nt time ( i * guess * ) to focus on the secondary characters ."," so , the manga is not better in regards to inner ( and outer , for that matter ) characterization ."," the anime is * miles * ahead of the manga ."," as for usagi s development in the anime , it s lacking a lot , i will give you that ."," every season it s the same thing  usagi fighting with chibiusa over mamoru , usagi and rei squabbling , fun filler episodes , and then bam , end of season , usagi gets super mature and saves the day ."," in the manga , however , it s almost radically different ."," usagi , at first , is vaguely ditzy and clumsy , but more cute than anything ."," it does nt take long , though , before her  flaws  are almost completely forgotten ."," iirc , she almost always does the right thing , her friends love her to death , and she can defeat any enemy at all with a single blast of energy ( something that really annoyed me ) ."," the story is mostly focused on this girl , who does nt really want to save the world , but does so anyway relatively easily ."," a lot of people say she s a mary - sue , but i always thought that was unfair to say that , especially because of the stars arc , where some more flaws of her come to light and she is knocked down a notch on the moral totem pole ."," but overall , manga usagi is just like anime usagi in that they both stay relatively the same throughout their respective runs , except manga usagi was dependably perfect while anime usagi was dependably imperfect ."," and personally , i prefer imperfect usagi  it makes things a lot more interesting when you do nt really know if usagi actually * can * save the day  she s so flaky and immature and does nt have such infinite , god - like powers ( as she does in the manga ) that she actually * really struggles * to defeat the big bad ."," i teared up at the end of s. plus , the inners get more representation in the defeat of the big bad in the anime than in the manga , where it s a generally solo - usagi style defeat ."," also , the manga made a huge deal of the power to defeat bad guys coming from the silver crystal , whereas the anime made a big deal of the power coming from usagi herself , as in , this young , whiny 14 - year - old girl has the power to defeat this amazingly - powerful evil being ?"," so , imo , the anime actually handles usagi far better than the manga  she s not this perfect , infinitely powerful being ."," she actually has real flaws and has to overcome them to be able to defeat the big bad ."," also , the inners are actually competent fighters ."," of course , there s the repetitiveness ."," this show is the scooby - doo of anime ."," similar to what someone else commented , the anime was targeting a particular demographic , skewing to younger viewers ( got ta sell those toys ! )"," it was based off of shows like power rangers  tokusatsu sentai shows that featured many special effects and had a  task force  of good - guy fighters ."," takeuchi herself said she wanted to make a  power rangers for girls  ."," that s why the show s so repetitive  they followed a formula to a ) save money ( kids , this is what stock footage is for ) , and b ) stay true to the roots of the show while also attracting boys with the action parts ."," it was , after all primarily an action show for kids  but that s also how they managed to tell an exceptionally compelling story on a shit ( okay , okay , * mediocre * ) budget ."," in a way , the manga is repetitive , too  every arc it s basically the same thing , but with different issues and characters ."," each chapter is quite different from the others , but the overall plotlines are vaguely similar ."," still , if you hate the formulaic - ness of the anime , then you might like the manga a lot more ."," especially since the manga does nt have the generally pleasant aura that the anime does  things get bad , and dark , and there s a lot of dying , and the final arc is awesome and epic and killer , however polarizing it may be ."," in the end , though , sailor moon is a feminist show at its heart ."," and i m

saazmarr ( dragonborn assassin )"," jenkins had n't always been his parents ' clan name ."," they used to have one more befitting of dragonborn , but they were exiled from the clan after completely screwing up diplomatic negotiations with an orc tribe ."," saddened and embittered , they moved to a small human village in the middle of nowhere , took the closest thing to a human clan name they could think of , and became blacksmiths ."," the townspeople accepted these new arrivals into their community , although they did remain a tad distant ."," the children were another matter ."," they bullied little saazmarr mercilessly ."," however , saazmarr knew that he could n't tell anyone , as snitching would only make the bullying worse ."," additionally , standing up for himself or retaliating directly was off the table as well , as saazmarr 's parents were hardcore pacifists who believed that violence should only be used when one 's life was in danger ."," so saazmarr did the only thing he could do : he concocted schemes that would embarrass or bring a small amount of harm to one of the aggressors , and execute it in such a way that nobody would ever figure out that it was anything but an accident ."," for the rest of saazmarr 's childhood , these pranks were his outlet ."," then the hoolihans moved into town ."," mr. hoolihan was a blacksmith , like saazmarr 's parents ."," he did n't like one bit the fact that the jenkinses could sell the same product for lower prices due to mr. jenkin 's firebreath eliminating the need for coal ."," so he started seeding rumors around town ."," rumors that the ignorant and small minded would find easy to believe ."," these rumors started spreading , and the townspeople grew more and more distant from the jenkinses ."," they were barely making any money ."," saazmarr 's bullying got worse , too : any ill luck , even things he did n't cause , were blamed on him ."," according to the hoolihans , dragonborn caused bad luck ."," the hatred fomented and got worse and worse ."," that is , until the day that saazmarr came home to find his mother bleeding out on the floor of the jenkins residence ."," five townspeople , four of them people they had known for sixteen years , had caught mrs. jenkins by surprise and beat her half to death ."," the fifth person was , of course , mr. hoolihan ."," mrs. jenkins desperately needed medical attention , but one of the attackers was the town healer ."," an hour later , she died in his and mr. jenkin 's arms ."," saazmarr knew that his father would just move away ."," he also knew that any law enforcement would take weeks to arrive and would n't care about a dead dragonborn ."," so he took things into his own hands ."," those five men 's screams echoed through the town for two days before dwindling one by one ."," anyone who tried to stop him was brutally and messily taken out ."," after those five , he tracked down the other town members one by one and ended them as well ."," while he knew that the king 's men did n't care about one dragonborn , reports of an entire slaughtered village would grab their attention ."," he fled , taking his father with him ."," mr. jenkins died within the week of a broken heart ."," his heart was broken both from losing his wife , and from seeing his son turn into a monster ."," saazmarr ran for months until he found a big city ."," there he makes a living killing for money ; after all , he does have more experience with it that most ."," ** personality and appearance **"," saazmar is a golden dragonborn who speaks with a southern drawl ."," he has a lithe , wiry build , typical of blacksmiths and their assistants ."," he is close to twenty - five years old ."," he is very polite and charming ; the southern gentleman 's gentleman ."," his poor old mother raised him right , after all ."," he refuses to tolerate any sort of racism or speciesism and will quickly come to blows with anyone who practices it ."," he is loyal to groups he joins , as he very much appreciates the value of teamwork : the village boys , for example , were able to regularly beat up a damn dragon and cause bruises through a thick hide and scales ."," however , he can be ruthless in pursuit of his goals ; he is lawful evil , after all ."," saazmarr very much blames his parents ' death on their original clan , and has been trying , so far fruitlessly , to find them ."," when he does , he intends to make them suffer as much or more than the villagers did ."," # 2 ) helper : classification delta ( warforged monk )"," a wizard , thromulus , lived deep in the woods on his own , conducting research into the nature of magic ."," however , many of the experiments he conducted would have been much easier to do with another set of helping hands ."," so , he designed helper alpha ."," unfortunately , the design of the magical core which powered alpha was flawed , and alpha exploded within one hour of coming to life ."," the area surrounding the explosion still is extremely chaotic due to magical fallout ."," beta was a simplified model , trading functionality for stability ."," however , when thromulus offhandedly ordered beta , \" ignore this order , \" beta had a meltdown ."," the failure of the magic that processed logic allowed the core to go critical , resulting in another explosion ."," thromulus ended up having to stimulate sentience in order to get a stable model ."," even after that , delta is  buggy ."," after routine self - maintenance ( rest ) , delta sometimes ca n't speak , loses pieces of memory , or limbs do n't work ."," fortunately , these issues typically resolve themselves after it shuts down for more self - maintenance ."," while the professor was elven , even elves die , and eventually , so did the wizard ."," near the end , he regretted how little good he had achieved with his life , and so with his last words , he gave delta a new prime directive : \" do something good ."," \" delta , unfortunately , has no idea what \" good \" is or how to do it ."," it has since been wandering , trying to find a logical definition ."," ** appearance \/ personality **"," delta is skinny , so it does n't take up too much space in a cramped area , and tall , perfect for reaching the top shelf ."," it is assembled mainly of metal ."," its eyes glow a gentle white ."," delta is cool - headed , logical ( what a surprise ! )"," , curious , and naive ."," it is guided , and then only barely , by some minimal rules that mainly involve not telling people about various tidbits of information that could lead to the creation of more helpers , and of course its prime directive ."," otherwise , it does whatever it wants ."," ** meta stuff : ** the reason delta is a monk is because it can channel energy ( from its magical core ) within itself , much like a monk ."," to simulate how ' buggy ' delta is , i was thinking that after every rest i could roll a d10 , and if i rolled a 1 , i would roll a d100 to figure out what negative effects delta gets for the day ."," it is true neutral , due to not knowing what the laws are or what good and evil truly are ."," # 3 ) jaine mrakas of the fifth holy order ( human fighter )"," what happens when someone who has sorcerous wild magic flowing in their veins but does n't want to be a sorcerer ?"," jaine was born into a small , cultish religion in which one of the primary tenets is that magic in any from is a corruption of the world , as it unnaturally twists it away from the great god 's plan ."," as a result , whenever she experiences extreme emotion , random , uncontrolled bits of magic start going off around her ."," things may twist , doves may appear from thin air , small fireworks displays may go off above her head , etc. ."," jaine was in deep denial about this , but after her betrothed died in an accident , twisted creatures which tried to harm people and destroy objects popped into existence around jaine ."," she was dishonorably discharged from the \" military \" ( guarded the village in which the cult lived ) and exiled until she \" cleanses \" herself ."," she is incredibly bitter about her \" impurity \" and is desperately trying to find a way to cleanse herself so she can return to where everyone follows the true word of the great god , may he be praised ."," ** appearance \/ personality **"," jaine is stocky , with shoulder - length dark brown hair and black , beady , narrow eyes ."," she is mistrustful of others and prideful ."," while she will work with others , she will always hold herself somewhat aloof ."," while she will try to get others to follow the path of righteousness , she is willing to accept that some are just lost to the way of roses and leaves them to their prettily - scented damnation ."," ** meta stuff : ** jaine is a fighter instead of a paladin or a cleric because what they do stinks too much of magic for the great god to have any truck with it ."," also none of the oaths paladins can take really align with my vision of jaine ."," she is lawful neutral , because although she sees what she does as good , good in d & d is like altruism , and the great god is
