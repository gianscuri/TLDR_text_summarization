."," she insisted that despite what i was saying , she would be there for me and that she loved me too much to lose me ."," i think at that time , she was a little down herself about being inbetween

wanted to go to where they were and have a drink and a quick bit there ."," i said , \" well , you guys would be coming back toward the house after that , so why do n't be meet down here ? \""," to

day resenting her ."," eventually we all went back home , took naps , went to dinner ( where i did n't talk much ) , and then when we got back home , i tried to go to sleep ."," i was laying in bed so sad and angry at everything ."," for some reason , i thought rather than pulling her aside and talking for a minute , i should just walk out of the house and have a beer alone ."," she texted me angry that i left ."," i said i just want a happy relationship again ."," she said she did also ."," sunday morning , she says she ca n't do it anymore ."," i go to work and try to talk to her after work

were great ."," the next morning i woke up early and made here breakfast ."," she says \" i do n't know why you did that , i 'm trying to make this easy \" ."," i beg and i plead for another chance ,

{"id":"train-TLDR_RC_2020-07-23-cm-1758.json","document":["our story begins with the italo - turkish war of 1911 ."," the war broke out when italians , after long years of negotiations with other european powers and plans , decided to invade and colonise libya ."," libya then was formally part of the ottoman empire ."," however , with the capture of egypt by the british in 1882 , it no longer had any land connection to the rest of the empire ."," with the ottoman navy not being in excellent condition for a long time and especially suffering decay under abdulhamid ii , the naval connection was , at best , shaky as well ."," it was in this context that the italians started their military operations in libya ."," contrary to what all this might suggest , and despite some revolutionary military tactics such as the very first example of aerial bombardment , the italians did not occupy the whole of libya quickly ."," the local forces of the ottomans , supported by local tariqahs and tribes , would prove to be formidable opponents against them in guerilla warfare , especially far away from the coast ."," the ottoman government also managed to support its forces on the ground and the tribes by sending a group of young officers , including enver ( later became a pasha and the minister of war during the ww1 ) and mustafa kemal ( later became atatrk ) beys ."," as a response , italians decided to hit ottomans elsewhere , using the advantage of their navy ."," a particular place they hit the ottomans were precisely those islands in the aegean sea called the dodecanese islands ."," italian navy surrounded them , landed troops , and soon the islands were captured one after the other by the italians ."," the italian government intended this as leverage against ottomans , to force them to come to terms with the italians , to leave libya in exchange of the islands ."," the plan worked as the ottoman government signed the treaty of ouchy in 1912 with italy , according to which ottomans would leave libya but take back the dodecanese islands in return ."," yet , the ottomans had enemies elsewhere with plans of their own ."," before the treaty of ouchy could be implemented , the first balkan war broke out ."," the balkanian states of bulgaria , greece , serbia , and montenegro attacked the ottoman empire and recorded noteworthy victories ."," especially the bulgarians proved particularly effective and , with the internal political divisions within the ottoman army , they took edirne and came very close to the ottoman capital ."," the first balkan war was followed very soon by the second balkan war , which ended in 1913 and saw edirne return to the ottoman empire ."," around a year later , the first world war would break out ."," as you can see , the ottomans did not particularly have any time to do much about the fate of the islands at all , which remained under italian hands as a result ."," from the ww1 the ottomans emerged defeated and forced to sign the treaty of sevres in 1920 ."," the relationships between italy and its allies at this time were quite strained , in part due to their ideas of sharing anatolia being worlds apart ( though they also had disagreements elsewhere , in particular on the italian - yugoslavian border ) ."," italians thus obtained significant portions of southern anatolia ( including antalya and konya ) but agreed to hand over the dodecanese islands to the greeks in exchange ."," yet , this treaty too failed to materialise because of the turkish war of independence ( 1919 - 1923 ) ."," with the turks defeating the allies and nullifying the treaty of sevres , the status of the islands became once more up for debate \/ negotiation ."," as a result of the turkish war of independence , the treaty of lausanne was signed , with which turkey recognised italian rule in the islands ."," thus they * de jure * became part of italy too , following a period of over 10 years under * de facto * italian control ."," until the ww2 , the islands remained part of italy ."," with the surrender of italy in 1943 , the islands ( which were used by italians as naval bases for their campaigns elsewhere ) became a battleground between the allies ( including greece ) and the axis ( by now just germany ) ."," with the germans losing , the legal status of the islands once more became subject of diplomatic debate ."," as the greeks were part of the winning side and as the islands had greek majority , it was deemed appropriate for them to become part of greece ."," at this time , turkey did not have much say ."," it did not exert any actual control over the islands for the last 30 years and formally recognised the loss of control in 1923 ."," the islands ' turkish population was by now very much limited ."," turkey was also not formally part of the war until its very end ."," the only way turkey could reestablish control over the islands was joining the war on the opposite side of greece , which would mean an axis turkey , which in turn would probably mean a soviet - occupied turkey at the end of the war ."," with hindsight , it seems not joining the war for the islands was the more prudent decision ... that said , i know that some circles in turkey are still quite shocked by how turkey does not control those islands so close to it ."," that belongs more to modern turkish politics than history though , so i will leave it here ."],"summary":"italy took them from turkey during the italo - turkish war of 1911 - 12 , turkey did not ( and could not ) interfere later , italy

wars in recent memory , the idea of the change and evolution of ideas still holds ."," hegel is a friend of the historian because he believes understanding the past is a deeply worthwhile effort even if he is largely skeptical of the idea that knowledge acquired from the past can be used to predict the future ."," while hegel indulges in a number of predictions himself and believes that attempting to predict the future is important to moving progress forward , he claims that no policy maker ever did learn the lessons of the past , and would be the first to acknowledge that his own theories and patterns are no more inviolate than any others in that they are only true in their historical moment ."," the second important thing hegel provides the historian is a unique perspective of the relationship between the individual and society , a concept of crucial importance to any historian ."," in contrast to many of his contemporaries , who argued that human beings were autonomous , atomistic individuals who inevitably followed their own self - interest according to the principles of utilitarianism ."," hegel argues that the individual is deeply enmeshed in social ideas ."," for hegel , simply stating that humans follow their self - interest is a gross oversimplification of human nature , as is kant 's idea of the categorical imperative on the other hand ."," for hegel , human goals are complex and inherently defined by a human being 's relationships with other human beings ."," for example , what i desire , believe to be true and enjoy might be completely different from another person from another place and time ."," for example , what a medieval catholic european monk desired and believed to be true is very different from what a secular utilitarian in the eighteenth century ."," people are complex and want socially determined things like status , recognition , friendship , love , expression , property , power , beauty and intellectual achievement ."," for hegel , the basic foundation of human society and all our ideas , indeed the thing that separates sentient from non-sentient beings is the recognition that other individuals are also conscious , the recognition of them as subject with desires that we ought to respect ."," when we treat other humans as objects that serve only to satisfy our desires , we oppress them , but also delude ourselves into thinking we are more powerful than we are , that we are immune from the need for recognition ."," from here comes hegel 's famous master - slave dialectic , crucial to understanding the idea of oppression and exploitation ."," hegel believed that to understand any person in any time period , one had to know what they were dealing with rather than apply a standard , universal rule of human behavior ."," one must trace what ideas they believed to be true , what language they spoke , what society they lived in , what form of government they lived under to truly understand what is going on ."," this basic principle is crucial one for a historian ."," understanding the status of women , the concept of the individual , the biases and interests of a given author , politics and so on in history requires us to examine the ideas , institutions and culture present at that time ."," hegel is certainly not an easy read , so much of what we know of him is filtered through different sources ."," for example , a great deal of thinkers were extremely hostile to hegel and have largely succeeded in casting him as everything from so obscure as to be meaningless to the arch-philosopher of totalitarianism ."," on the other hand , marx , another thinker deeply concerned with history , adapted hegel to create his own theory ."," marx claimed to be completely and reforming hegel 's ideas , not overturning them and many of marx 's basic ideas about historical materialism have become fundamental to our understanding of history , making it difficult to untangle marx 's ideas from hegel ."," meanwhile , nietzsche adopted a number of hegelian ideas and moved in an entirely different direction than marx , adding even more to the confusion ."," today , it is possible to find two writings about hegel that seem to agree on almost nothing about him ."," generally , you will find either existentialism \/ analytic philosophy sympathizing works that brand him as the creator of a modern - day - theology which entombd the individual into conformity and moreover perpetuated a white , male , western discourse on the one hand and neo-marxists who argue that hegel was a genius who was the first to understand the true nature of history , society , human nature and ideas , but whose contribution has been sadly forgotten because it offends utilitarian and libertarian thought and because it 's author wrote in dismally dense prose ."," i tend towards the latter opinion , but it 's certainly a bias ."],"summary":"in my private , rambling opinion , hegel is a valuable philosopher for historians to understand because of his ideas of the historicity of human knowledge , the relation between the individual and society and of the basic structure of human relations

up with a few years ago and spent a lot of time improving ."," if you 'd like to see similar posts to this , check out my post history , i have a bunch more that i did a while ago ."," ** how this works **"," if you 've seen my previous posts , you most likely know the basics of how i do this , but i continue to tweak things to try and improve , so i will outline all of that here ."," feel free to skip this if you do n't care , because it 's long ."," first of all , you will notice in my chart , nine different columns : year , weight , g , a , p , g , a , time weight ( g ) , and time weight ( a ) ."," year is the year that those stats are from , the first weight is the weight of the league he played in compared to the nhl ( these are called nhle numbers or nhl translation factors [ shoutout to rob vollman with hockey abstract for publishing these [ nhl translation factors ] ( https:\/\/twitter.com\/hockeyabstract\/status\/984181939857862656?lang=en ) ] ) , g is goals , a is assists , p is points , g is change in goals , a is change in assists , time weight ( g ) is a weight to g that makes more recent changes have a larger impact , and time weight ( a ) is the same thing for a ."," the stats with the  ( that i call \" change in stats \" ) show the change in goals and assists from the previous season ."," the first season will always have nothing since there is n't a season to compare it to ."," the other seasons will be calculated with ( current season stat ) \/ ( previous season stat ) ."," this gives me an idea of how they tend to change year to year , but the most recent years are the most significant , so that is why i have included the second weight ."," now if you look at the rows , there are three rows per year : actual , on pace for , and nhl pace ."," actual is what they actually got that season and in however many games they played ."," on pace for is what they would have got if they played 82 games ."," i know not all leagues play 82 games , but for the sake of a fair comparison , i use 82 since that is what the nhl uses ."," keep in mind these numbers are always floored , in other words they are rounded down ."," this is because i do n't think rounding up is fair because there is no such thing as a fraction of a goal , the goals you get are any whole goals you have achieved ."," nhl pace is the on pace for row multiplied by the translation factor ."," once again , this number is rounded down ."," this number is also the one that is compared for the change in stats ."," the time weights try to make sure that players who have been improving recently , when in the past they may not have , or players who have been declining , and used to improve or be consistent a lot in the past , favor the more recent records ."," players who are improving tend to continue improving and players who are declining tend to continue to decline ."," now , how is this calculated ?"," i am using the formula :"," ( number of seasons - 1 ) \/ x ) \/ (  ( ( number of seasons - 1 ) \/ i ) from i = 1 to number of seasons - 1 ) , where x is 1 if it is the last season , 2 for the one before that , 3 for the one before that , and so on ."," hopefully that is clear , and i will continue on to the next step of outlier elimination ."," to get rid of any change in stats that stick out , i do an outlier calculation ."," this is done by taking the median of all change in stats , then from that i take the first and third quartiles ."," these are basically the median between the lowest number and the median and the median between the median and the largest number ."," then i take the interquartile range ( iqr ) , which is just ( third quartile ) - ( first quartile ) ."," then i calculate an x value which is the iqr * 0.25 , and add that to the third quartile to get my upper bound and subtract x from the first quartile to get my lower bound ."," anything outside of that is no good and gets thrown away ."," next is the average calculation ."," the first average is just the average of all numbers including outliers ."," the second average is the average that does not have any outliers included ."," the third and newest average is a weighted average that takes each change in stat that is not an outlier and multiplies it by its weight and sums all of them together ."," to get the final expected value for next season , i used to just take the player 's last season and multiply it by the averages , but now i take the average of the player 's entire career for goals and assists and compare them to their last two seasons ."," whichever of the two seasons is closer in each individual stat is given a slightly higher weight ."," this will help account for a slump season , where it will assume that this is unlikely to occur again , but wo n't assume that they will immediately return to form ."," the closer season will have a influence 67 % of the expected value and the other season will influence 33 % ."," this value will then be multiplied by the weighted average for change in stats and that will be the final result ."," the montreal expected is simply the weighted expected multiplied by last year 's goals for by montreal divided by the league average goals for ."," this gives a small change in the expected production based on the offensive capabilities of the team ."," * change in goals *"," *

properly as puppies with other dog breeds , children , adults , and often world situations other than their own ( sounds , places , public transportation , social gatherings ) they can and absolutely will learn what we consider anti social behaviors that is often more difficult to break ."," they usually only trust their inner circle but are able to adapt to strangers easier if their inner circle is diverse ."," ancient dog breeds have the highest abandonment percentage within their first two years of life and are either given to a shelter , a breed specific haven or ultimately put down for

ancient dog breeds are obviously the shar pei , akita inus , chow chows , and even our lovable doge the shiba inu ."," out of the fourteen ancient dog breeds the majority of them are well known for being aloof ( only loving to their pack or known circle ) , aggressive towards other animals or dogs that are larger or smaller than them , dominant and territorial , and naturally guarded or over protective ."," i 'm not going to sit here and tell you the reason why your dog is a bad citizen is because you 're a bad owner because that would be cruel and most likely a lie ."," a lot of why your dog has turned out this way is due to his deeply imbedded and dominant instinct , something these specific ancient dog breeds are known for ."," these dogs are in fact so difficult to tame that most home insurance companies will not cover you if you have some of them ( for instance the akita or chow chow and yes you guessed it , the shar pei ) it is not uncommon for landlords to reject people because of these breeds ."," i have two shiba inus and they are the perfect example of their breed ."," i often compare owning a shiba to having picked up a wild animal in the forest and putting it in

hated everyone else and we finally figured out why ."," he was raised in a small household of five people , four of which are short women and one average height man ."," he was not introduced properly

instincts are telling them to do ."," we got desperate , we could n't take him to the dog park or even walk him without him attempting to attack other dogs and sometimes he was able to dig out of our yard and do exactly that because my scumbag steve of a neighbor beats his dogs into submission and leaves them on his porch without supervision multiple times a day ."," during this time they would run up and down against my fence growling and barking aggressively at my shiba so whenever he could , my shiba would try to find a way to the other side if they where out ."," we had to lock our doggy

answer a single , relevant philosophical question in today 's modern age ."," a lot of people watch tbl and say at the end of it : \" what the hell was that movie about ? \""," watch a little closer and you 'll see ."," anyway , like i was saying , the film answers a single , very important philosophical question , a question that is posed at the beginning of the film by the big lebowski ( the character ) : \" what makes a man ? \""," the rest of the film is devoted to answering this question ."," or , if i were to rephrase this in a way relevant to reality , the film questions the conventional notion of a \" man \" or masculinity in today 's society ."," sorry , that was really wordy ."," let 's get concrete ."," men in the past proved they were \" men \" by going out and hunting , providing for their family , doing typical strong manly man stuff ."," if i were to ask you \" what 's the first thing you think of when i say the words \" masculine man \" ? \""," i 'm willing to bet many will picture a 6ft tall , muscular fellow , who has girls hanging off of his bulging biceps like moths to a lamp ."," but is n't this idea kind of ridiculous when you think about it ?"," that what we define to be masculine , what society defines to be masculine , what \" makes \" a man is nothing more than good looks and well - maintained body ?"," back to the scene in the study ."," the big lebowski asks the dude \" what makes a man ? \""," and the dude does n't know ."," he says the technically correct answer \" a pair of testicles \" ."," again , the theme is that masculinity is defined by body image ."," the question is set there for the whole audience to see , and the rest of the movie is spent delving into this question ."," sorry , i lied when i said a single question is asked and answered ."," the secondary sub question is : \" how do men prove that they are \" men \" in today 's society ? \""," surely there are n't anymore animals to hunt in our suburban neighborhoods , no more gangs of roaming bandits to defend our land and women from ."," so how are men in the 21st century to prove that they are men ?"," the film takes all pre-conceived societal notions about masculinity being defined as body image , and turns all of that on its head with jeff bridge 's character the dude ."," here we have : an unemployed slacker and stoner , physically unfit , cowardly , poor , etc. etc. as far from society 's ( and the audience 's ! )"," notion of what a real manly character should be ."," by the end of the movie , one can certainly make the claim that the dude is not cowardly ."," does n't he spend the film trying to dive to the bottom of a mystery that he does n't even want to be a part of ?"," despite what he may appear to be on the outside , by the end of the movie the dude is definitely more courageous and willing to do what 's right than at the beginning ."," remember that scene at the bowling alley ?"," when the dude converses with the cowboy ?"," watch that scene very closely ."," before that scene occurs , the dude is cowardly ."," after that scene , there 's a marked change in character ."," he 's more daring (

the answer to the both questions ."," what makes a man , and how are men in the 21st century able to prove that they are men to society ."," the answer is n't a hot body ."," the answer is n't wealth ."," the answer is n't fame ."," the answer is courage and integrity ."," willing to do what 's right in the face of danger , never compromising in your ideals ."," the dude certainly is n't perfect

every single male character in that film is flawed ?"," the big lebowski is flawed physically , being confined to a wheelchair ( and yet he achieved anyway !"," surely money makes a man ... or does it ? )"," walter is flawed psychologically , overcompensating for his lack of assertiveness ( he does n't tell his ex-wife off for asking to take care of her dog ) with his overly macho attitude ."," he represents the whole host of men in society who overcompensate for their real masculinity ( again , the film 's answer is courage and integrity ) with anything else ( arrogance , violence ) ."," donny is cowardly , too afraid to even defend his friends in the fight in the parking lot ."," even minor characters , like the dude 's landlord is just , well , plain weird ."," none of the male characters in the film are the 6ft tall , muscular and athletic \" manly \" men image that society perceives masculinity to be ."," by comparison , every woman in the film is a strong character ."," bunny is

weekend you might have tuned in to see a fairly small set of games against another grandmaster , zaowi ."," if you 've been on the duelyst subreddit much over the past year you will also recognise me ."," anyway , today i want to talk to everyone about the dwc format , and tournament formats for the future ."," firstly , the tournament format for the dwc was announced a little over 2 weeks before the event ."," originally day 2 was going to be single elimination conquest best of 5 with a ban ( 4 total decks ) ."," overall the grandmasters felt that such a small set of games would be highly luck based and uninteresting ."," after some discussion , a day later it was set in stone that this would be double elimination conquest best of 7 with a ban , increasing the total to 5 decks ."," i personally raised some concerns about this format , but the general consensus was that it was fine ."," i see a lot of comments on reddit , twitch and discord regarding the conquest format of the dwc , especially where you have to bring 5 decks , being responsible for the mechaz0r victory ."," this is partly true , in that technically the best strategy was simply to have a lineup that exploited the weakest part of your opponent 's lineup ."," it just so happens that in this case the best exploit was mech , but i 'm fairly certain that running this scenario several times would yield differing results , sometimes it 's mech , sometimes it 's super aggressive fast lists , sometimes it 's super greedy control lists , and very rarely it 's fairly balanced lists ."," in case you are unaware of what conquest means , the format has players choose a number of decks and must secure a win with every deck , once a player has won with a deck they may not play it again in that match , but otherwise may switch decks as they please ."," the conquest format was largely popularized for online ccg by blizzard 's hearthstone ."," the developers decided to switch from the previous last hero standing to conquest to try and showcase more decklists , rather than have a single powerful deck sweep opponents ."," hearthstone has never been a pinnacle of competitiveness , so very little concern was given as to how good this change was for competitiveness ."," as it turns out , in a 2 - 3 deck format it is n't too bad , as it means that you are forced out of your comfort zone , while still having a rather tight lineup ."," the problem arises the more decklists you add to the lineup , especially if you add bans ."," the more decks you add , the weaker the decks become ( because they flow down the tier list ) , the less trained with them a player is ( because players only have so much time to play ) , the more likely your lineup is to include something that can be ' countered ' ( because you include so many lists ) and the more games you are likely to play with a weak , unrefined , easily counterable decklist ( losing decks play multiple times while winning decks play once ) ."," this is especially exasperated by the addition of a ' ban ' where you either remove your opponent 's best deck , or your lineups strongest counter ( or if you are lucky , both ) ."," it can be argued this adds ' strategy ' to the process , but the strategy added is far outweighed by the imbalances it creates ."," matches are not decided by players at their best , but rather players at their worst ."," to understand why this is an issue , it is best to look at more established sports for guidance ."," in events for car races , athletic sprints , olympic trials , etc. they usually allow several attempts taking your best score , or at least your average score , often even discounting your lowest score ."," they never disregard your best scores and add extra weighting to your worst scores ... it seems so foolish in that context to even suggest it , and yet for whatever reason that is what is considered standard in duelyst ."," ** last hero standing **"," again in case you do not know the format , last hero standing has players bring a number of decks , they must stay with the same deck until it loses , and then may not use that deck again , once they have no decks remaining then they lose ."," this format allows dreaded powerful decks to often sweep opponents without losing , having people often reach finals being relatively undefeated ."," the positive side of this is that it allows players to primarily focus on their ' main ' deck and still perform well in tournaments ."," i do not have much more to say about this format ."," i will say that it is generally considered sub-optimal as matches can often be decided by the early mirrors when one or two decks are very clearly ahead of the other decks in the meta ."," having whole multiple game matches decided primarily by the first game result can be very frustrating , and i do not suggest this as a pure replacement to conquest ."," before i talk about other formats i wanted to spend a little bit talking about bans ."," ideally bans are used to help players deal with clearly strong decks and \/ or seal up weaknesses in their lineup ."," as far as i can tell the addition of the ban to the ccg format was to deal with archetypes that players felt were too strong but the developers had yet to deal with ."," the problem i have with this system is that it feels to me as though it misses a large part of the fundamental competitiveness of the game ."," there have been great pieces written by some of the best players in the world talking about how the competitive scene should be used to shape game balance , and not the other way around ."," forcing players to decide bans so as to ' fix ' glaring issues with a game often creates a game state that is just as bad ."," the problems with bans are relatively small in comparison to other formats issues though so is not worth elaborating on ."," there actually exists a vast number of different ways a match can be played ."," the main problem is that conquest and last hero standing are by far the simplest and easiest to understand for most players ( with the exception of just having 1 decklist ) ."," it makes tournaments a lot easier to run and manage when everyone easily understands how they are supposed to play ."," we can theorize about what the most fair and effective format might be , but if it exceeds a certain level of complexity then it not be effective for tournaments ."," the exception to this is of course high level finals tournaments like the dwc ."," these tournaments have a very small pool of players whom are all rather experienced with understanding rulesets ."," a personal suggestion of mine is ** revised conquest ** where it follows the normal rules for conquest , with the exception that any deck may be used to win twice ."," this overall reduces the excessive number of decklists , while also giving stronger representation to a player 's favored decklist ."," now , rather than playing more games with their worst decks , top players are inherently more likely to play more with their best deck , but will still never have that complete sweep power ."," this is a closer representation of other competitions where you are more strongly judged on your best and not your worst ."," i would love to hear some discussion and revision of other formats ."," the simpler the format is the better suited for large tournaments like opens and weeklies ."," the more complex , but fairer , a format is , the better suited it is for specialized tournaments like invitationals and finals ."],"summary":"dwc 5 decklist conquest format was not ideal for the competition . in conquest the more decks you add , the weaker the decks become , the less trained with them a player is , the more likely your lineup is to

i knew she always suffered from low confidence , despite trying my best to support her and remind her she 's beautiful at every opportunity etc , but i know that most of it is ' wasted ' , i tried my best ."," she revealed a week later that she thinks she might be asexual ( someone who does n't experience romantic attraction ) , i told her i was somewhat hurt by that but was willing to work things out ."," she said she felt guilty about not being able to ' satisfy me ' which was already hard due to the long distance , and that she needed to explore what she wanted , so she ended the relationship again ."," which i supported , however , this time no contact ."," about 12 hours after we broke up , she contacted me , telling me she was wrong to think that she was asexual and she could work things out , which i of course , agreed to support her ( are you notocing a pattern ? )"," and work things out ."," great , things were finally back to normal and she was eager to get back together ."," i asked her if it 's really what she wanted and gave her multiple options to walk away from the relationship , and she said it was what she really wanted and that i was worth challenging her character over ( with regards to sexual stuff ) ."," then comes this week , it 's exam week and she has a big exam that she has to study for on thursday and i know from experience to take off the pressure and that she would get distant , but would return to normal after the exams are over ."," today she decided she wanted to end the relationship to focus on herself , what she wanted and her relationships with her family and friends ."," she wanted to take time off to explore herself and to focus on her thesis without having to worry about ' measuring up to be a good girlfriend ' or not ."," i told her i did n't have any issues with our relationship and that i did n't mind being patient , so she ended it again , no contact , once again ."," a mutual friend spoke to me ( i know that 's something i should n't do , but they had a lot to tell me ) and told me that she was glad to finally ' take out the trash ' and that she is ' naive for not seeing this before ' , what she was referring to was , earlier on in the day she told me that she had met someone who preferred the pronouns ' them \/ they ' and i made a little joke , nothing offensive , but i just joked that it would be difficult for me to remember which pronouns to use and she got upset ."," i assume , because of the stress from exams and i appologized ."," the mutual friend also told me that she feels ' free ' and ' wants a girlfriend ' ."," however , the reasons she told me for breaking up were completely different ."," i know the reason for breakup should be irrelevant , i 'm just a little annoyed by that , i suppose ."," anyway , that 's it ."," i just felt like writing this all to get it off of my chest ."," if you have any advice as for what to do ( i 'm guessing she 'll contact me after her exams are finished once again , but i do n't really care either way ) , feel free ."," if you have anything supportive to say or even something critical , go ahead , i just kind of wanted to speak about this ."],"summary":"ld girlfriend broke up with me , not sure how to feel

possibility of seeing other people ."," we managed to work out our prior grievances but i ca n't help but feel cheated ."," during the break he has spent a large amount of time with his friends which was to be expected , but i did feel neglected considering he would only make the effort to see me if his prior plans were cancelled and our dates were no where near as grandiose as the hang out with his friends ."," our spring break was last week and we went on a fairly nice date on march 19th where he held my hand , he said i love you , he seemed happy ."," however , through this month he has been changing ."," he has always been prim and proper and i was the only who would be outlandish and the dynamic work ."," however , i find that lately he has been extremely casual and he honestly is a complete 180 of the guy i first started dating ."," i was happy in a way because the traditional side of him was a bit of a bother but this new ."," \" cool \/ cocky \" attitude is a bit overdone ."," a few days after i asked him if we could talk about the break and he just goes , \" oh yeah !"," things went back to normal so i totally forgot we were even on a break \" which was dumb and also highly unlike him ."," i did n't feel relieved now that the \" break \" was officially over ."," things seemed to go back to normal as he said but they still felt ."," i checked his reddit , which he did tell me his username ages ago but i think he forgot , and he posted saying how he 's falling for a classmate , hard ."," and he mentions that he went out to bars , museums , and concerts 5 times over the break ."," i felt so fucking blindsided ."," during break he would always ask me what i 'm doing and who i was hanging out with but never told me this ."," what bothered me even more was that the post was in regards to if he has a chance with her ."," he did n't even mention that he 's still in a relationship at all ."," the advice given to himis that he should pursue this girl and he seems like he will ."," i planned a date this friday but i told him i want to cancel it and have a talk instead ."," i do n't know how to feel ."," i felt like him blindsiding me was also my fault because earlier that week we watched an episode of a show that consists of drama , murder , and a gratuitous amount of affairs ."," i told him that if i were ever cheated on i would rather not know and i feel like physical cheating is more vile than emotional ."," upon reading his post i wanted to take it all back ."," both forms of cheating are obviously vile and i do want to know why he did this ."," i guess my question is , what do you think of this situation and how should i approach this on friday ?"],"summary":"boyfriend made posts saying he wants to break up and is falling for a

confidently say best friends ."," as in most cases with girl and guy relationships i started to develop feelings for her ."," i know there is an age difference not huge by numbers but by maturity but i was pretty mature for 18 at the time and she did n't seem to mind ."," i did n't tell her how i felt since i figured it 'll change things and it would n't matter since she lived in another state ."," i guess she started to realize i did since she texted me one day out of the blue with a straight forward \" do you like me text \" ?"," i replied \" i would be lying if i said no \" she did n't think much of it but now she knew ."," keep in mind c and i have never been in any relationships ."," after she found this out things changed for the better and we started to be even closer than before and being very flirty , she would call me after work and tell me how her day was going and we would also watch netflix while talking to each other over skype ."," it kinda felt like we were in a ldr with out the title ."," things got really really close since she started telling me things that were very explicit , she started telling me how she was horny and she would also send me pictures of herself and too would kindly deliver ."," this went on for a month and one night we were talking on the phone and she seemed quieter than usual and told me not to get mad ."," i did n't know what what she meant but a few minutes later i got a message from my friend m and he knew that i had feelings for her so he showed me screenshots of the texts c was sending him while i was talking to her ."," she was sending him texts basically confessing her love for him saying that shes always loved him since she first met him ."," he did n't really care since he did n't really acknowledge her she meant nothing to him ."," i was upset and angry at the same time so i hung up and did n't talk to her for two weeks ."," she did n't try to talk to me and was a complete beta so i called her and said although it was fucked up we were never officially titled as bf \/ gf ."," some time past after this and we drifted apart , 4 months past and little by little we started to talk again just like before ."," then also like the past we started to be flirty but i could n't forget what happened so i agreed i would n't get too attached ."," this time seemed like a for sure deal we would be together since she was n't interested in m anymore ."," a month goes by just like before with phone calls , movies , sexting , etc. all that good stuff ."," i was n't too big on the whole long distance relationship but i was willing to try for her ."," she tells me she likes me but she does n't believe in ldr ."," the week after this happened she started to distance herself again ."," then she gives me the cold shoulder and ignores my texts and calls i soon find out she has a boyfriend and shes in a ldr ."," i found out and for the second time i was crushed ."," two months go by and she texted me saying hello and how i 've been ."," i 'm not a dick so i reply and talk to her like a good friend would ask her how she is , how shes been , and if she still in her relationship she tells me she wants to break up with him ."," i ask why and she says hes too much of a dick and does n't really acknowledge her and how i used to treat her way better and how much more of a good time she had with ."," she asks me if she should break up with her boyfriend ."," i told her i did n't know that was a choice she had to make but i also told her not to expect me to go back to how i was with her before ."," three months later which is this last week i start getting texts from c saying how she misses me and she has n't stopped thinking about me ."," i do n't want to stop talking to her because i connect with this girl on a whole different level ."," what i mean is we both have the same sense of humor , we know what each other is thinking before we say it , we enjoy each others company , and way too many times so much that we 've freaked each other out have we said the exact same thing simultaneously ."," i told her i would think about us and she said she would n't mind being just friends , but you guys will have to excuse me for being a horny 19 year old but i 've seen her nude and she is very very very attractive to me that i know if we are friends ill try and make a move on her and shell be vulnerable to it since she is into me but i would n't want to give her false hope on a relationship , but again i 'm not sure if ill ever connect to someone on this same level ."," what i did n't

evolution , but i just ca n't accept that a series of slight adaptations stacked in such an intelligent way ."," all the evidence nature provides makes me think something , whether it be an otherworldly energy based being or an intangible concept , had to manipulate life to be so diverse and have so many checks and balances , and not a thoughtless genetic lottery ."," we see in the modern day the dangers of invasive species wiping out entire ecosystems , and if anything that points to eventual biouniformity as opposed to biodiversity ."," if earth was teeming with predators and prey and one prey just so happened to survive over its slightly different relative , how does the mutations stack to resemble a predator in time to have a significantly increased survival rate ?"," if the mutations were gradual , then at what point does a mutation have a quantifiable advantage ?"," a mutation of this magnitude , to be advantageous , would have to make an incredible leap within one or a very low number of generations , and if that were so it would be so markedly different in appearance alone not to mention genetically mutated that it 's likely it 's very different looking opposite sex peers would not be attracted to it let alone be able to mate with it ."," vestigial organs are one big hurdle that creationists ca n't get around understandably , but to say that they are purposeless in those animals is often scientific ignorance , for if they were purposeless , then according to the philosophy of evolution they should have been scrapped long ago ."," a whale with \" bones \" resembling a hand does n't mean they descended from mammals , it just means they have micro maneuverability with each set of bones to allow incredible movement in the sea , much like a mitten still allows a measure of finger dexterity ."," in recent years the appendix has been discovered to aid in digestion of varied nonstandard diets ."," even the rare protruding coccyx , or tailbone , and the \" tail \" thst can sometimes appear to be sttached to it ( that is often cited as a vestigial tail ) has never been proven to have any sort of vertebrate inside of it , other then the potruding coccyx itself ."," it was based on many spurious accounts of babies with tails at a time when phrenology and electro shock therapy were standard medical practice ."," even the beaks of

."," so many of insects and plants camouflage adaptations are far too detailed as well ."," i would have an easier time believing that there is some sort of epigenetic consciousness that ties all

evidence ."," as for who or what intervened that 's a question for another time , but as someone truly open to the idea of anything else , all the evidence , and lack thereof , that i 've seen does not support the random genetic lottery hypothesis ."," to believe in random chaos bringing about order takes more belief , more faith , than observing the obvious complexity of everything around us , from small to great , and attributing it to something incredibly intelligent beyond ourselves ."," downvote me if you like , i just want convincing and overwhelming body of evidence to the contrary ,

happening in flint ."," dumbest waste of a pundit career in a good long while for that one ."," frankly brazile definitely should have known better and should have resigned quite a bit earlier if she was going to be working with democratic campaigns instead of trying to double dip and keep her pundit career as well . >"," in all seriousness ... i recall one particular moment when she introduced  russia  into the conversation and it was completely absurd ."," little did i know obama and co abused the fisa warrant process and tried to frame trump with the fake steele dossier that was originally manufactured by the rnc and then sold to the democrats as  oppo research  ."," so i do agree that the fisa warrant process was messed up and i do hope the fbi was serious in saying that it has put in some work to reform it ."," the acknowledgment to the surveillance court is the latest fallout from december 's scathing inspector general report , which faulted the fbi for a series of misstatements and omissions in the applications to get secret court warrants to eavesdrop on page . >"," the justice department 's concession to the court means the department now believes , at a minimum , the surveillance of page should have ended after the second warrant expired in early 2017 ."," so while [ two of the four ] ( https:\/\/www.cnn.com\/2020\/01\/23\/politics\/fisa-carter-page-warrants\/index.html ) fisa warrants on page should not have been issued , i think it 's still worth noting that there was in fact enough evidence that even two fisa warrants were apparently correctly applied for in their investigation into him ."," and beyond that , what does president obama have to do with it ?"," he does n't run the fbi , nor does he have the ability to influence their counter-intelligence operations , though he certainly does have the ability to be informed about them if \/ when they find something notable ."," so i do also take a little issue with how you 're describing the steele dossier here ."," one , it 's a real document , so the idea that it 's \" fake \" in and of itself is already , well , wrong i guess ?"," second , nothing in it has been concretely disproven , though a large number have actually been proven ."," they include : - russia being behind the wikileaks leaks with the help of julian assange ."," mueller indicted 12 gru officers on hacking and conspiracy charges relating to the 2016 dnc hack and the dissemination of stolen emails via guccifer 2.0 , who was also revealed to be a government hacker for russia ."," guccifer [ colluded ] ( https:\/\/www.justsecurity.org\/45435\/timeline-roger-stone-russias-guccifer-2-0-wikileaks\/ ) with roger stone on the [ best time ] ( https:\/\/www.newsweek.com\/how-stone-interacted-russias-guccifer-and-wikileaks-673268 ) to release [ the emails ] ( https:\/\/archive.thinkprogress.org\/roger-stone-guccifer-wikileaks-8f4d6d38a935\/ ) from the hack ."," - in return for the email dump , trump and his campaign would drop russian interference in ukraine as an issue in the campaign ."," it 's notable that a [ plank of the gop platform ] ( https:\/\/www.washingtonpost.com\/opinions\/global-opinions\/trump-campaign-guts-gops-anti-russia-stance-on-ukraine\/2016\/07\/18\/98adb3b0-4cf3-11e6-a7d8-13d06b37f256_story.html ) relating to ukraine disappeared from the early drafts of the 2016 party platform soon after this arrangement was made , managed on trump 's side by paul manafort ."," - trump has , on numerous occasions , raised the issue of us \/ nato defense commitments in the baltics and eastern europe ."," he has attacked them for not spending enough and that the us would not continue supporting nato if they did n't meet their spending commitments ."," - trump 's business dealings in russia were part of his cultivation as a potential asset for the kremlin ."," michael cohen admitted under oath to prosecutors that trump was pursuing a trump tower moscow deal during the election even though he said he had n't , that the trump organization had sought direct assistance from the russian government for making it happen , and that trump was considering gifting putin the penthouse in any trump tower moscow project that would end up being completed ."," - trump lied numerous times about the meeting that don jr. had in trump tower in summer 2016 that was \" part of russia and its government 's support \" for trump 's candidacy ."," not only did he lie about it , he directed the writing of the statement released by don jr. when knowledge of the meeting went public ( and after jr. dumbass tweeted out the damn emails himself ) ."," - michael flynn was a russian collaborator ."," he got 35k to speak at a russian banquet celebrating the 10th anniversary of rt , where he was photographed sitting next to putin ."," he failed to disclose that payment when applying for a renewed security clearance in 2016 ."," he also illegally discussed us sanctions with russia with sergey kislyak , the russian ambassador to the us , during the presidential transition period ( again , highly illegal for flynn to be doing this and undermining president obama 's russia stance ) ."," flynn was also present during a meeting with kislyak and kushner when kushner wanted to discuss the setting up of a secret back - channel between the trump team and moscow ."," oh , and he was also involved in trying to get russia and saudi arabia nuclear reactors , which could really only happen if \/ when the us lifted sanctions on russia ."," massive detour away from the topics of your questions on the debates ."," i 'll get back to that now ."," i 'll start this part of my response by saying that i generally have a lot of problems with how debates are currently conducted , mostly because they are generally designed for sound bites , verbal jousting and just vague bullshit , not actually debating topics ."," so what i remember about the debates , going one by one ."," i went back to the transcripts just to firm up my memory on them ."," here 's what i remember : - lester holt was both a poor moderator and also restricted by the general format of the debate in keeping both clinton and trump from arguing , talking over each other and straight - up ignoring the time limits set ( time limits are definitely one of my biggest issues with current debates , but i can save that for a different comment ) ."," neither was able to get through a point uninterrupted terribly often ."," - i keep writing and deleting things to say about the first debate , but frankly , all i can say is that trump ( in my opinion ) lied a lot , put undeserved blame on clinton for things she as a senator and sos had no control over ( particularly the economy as well as the withdrawal of troops from iraq that allowed isis to rise up ) , and he has done a lot of the things he has said he would in this debate , and few if any have actually gone well for him while in office ."," - the second debate was the \" hollywood bus happened two days before \" debate ."," also the debate where trump thought it was appropriate \/ in good form to bring some of bill clinton 's accusers to sit in the crowd as if that made him look like anything other than a massive jackass ."," - so this is the debate that trump also brought up hillary 's emails ."," first off , they were only released because of , as i listed above when talking about the dossier , roger stone and other members of the trump campaign working with the russians to release it just hours after the access hollywood tape dropped ."," while legally clinton has been cleared , and it 's massively despicable that , at the time , trump thought clinton should be in jail , trump definitely shouted through and over clinton and she definitely did n't get enough time to put anything close to a proper response to it on the tape ."," - as for border security , trump brought it up in all three debates , which i actually did n't remember ."," so i guess good for him on that ?"," but now that we have seen his border policies in action , the implementation of his border security plans alone i believe should deserve him getting hauled into the hague on charges of crimes against humanity ."," border security in and of itself is whatever , people have wide varieties of what they believe needs to happen there , but his actions have shown him to be the exact kind of callous , sociopathic monster that gets one labeled as racist and those who support him called \" deplorables who are racist , sexist , homophobic and xenophobic . \""," so again , because i want to make sure this post stays up , here 's my question after this part of our discussion : what is your opinion on trump 's border policy and how it has been implemented ?"," do you believe that children should be separated from their parents ?"," do you believe that his intent to all but end the asylum system in violation of i do n't even know how many different international agreements is the kind of humane treatment we should be giving to people who want to come here for a better life ?"," do you believe that it should be easier or harder to enter this country and become a citizen , and why ?"],"summary":"i disagree with how you view the steele dossier , and i think trump has

hurdle to start with ."," i 'm not going to address this after this paragraph , but keep in mind that we would have to change legal precedent about who child support benefits to do this to start with ."," no reasonable person is going to make the case that a guy can make medical decisions for the woman because he does n't want to pay for a baby ."," but mras make the argument that men should be able to sign some sort of paperwork releasing them from financial responsibility while a woman is still pregnant in order to give them an option for abortion ."," they call this financial abortion sometimes ."," financial abortion will not work ."," it is bad public policy ."," here 's why , in chronological order : first thing that happens is the girl finds out she 's pregnant , right ?"," on average , women tend to find out around 4 to 6 weeks in that they are pregnant , though you can get a test that will tell you as early as two weeks , i believe ."," [ edit : i stand corrected ."," apparently it is two weeks from your first missed period , not two weeks after conception ."," so the 4 to 6 weeks average appears to be approximately the earliest you can tell if you are pregnant . ]"," remember that in most states , women only have a narrow window to abort without a reason , like medical issues , rape , or incest ."," in most states this is around 20 weeks ."," so here 's our average timeline ."," 20 weeks , and you have already lost 4 in the best case scenario ."," everyone would agree that getting this done after the abortion window would be unfair , right ?"," she has to have notice of his decision to be able to make a fully informed decision whether to abort or not ."," so first off , what happens in those rare cases where a woman did not know she was pregnant until late in the pregnancy ?"," those \" i did n't know i was pregnant scenarios \" ."," what is to stop a woman from avoiding any doctors or anyone while she is pregnant in order to avoid the guy opting out ?"," women who do this would greatly increase their chances of having a baby with developmental problems , since they wo n't be going to a doctor during the pregnancy ."," how do we decide which women were lying about not knowing they were pregnant and which women actually did not know ?"," do we have full trials on this issue to decide ?"," who pays for the extra court workers necessary for this increased case load ?"," would this be a separate court or can we use our current family law courts ( which are already overburdened and underfunded , guys ) ."," ok , so lets say that someone comes up with an answer on those questions , and we as a society decide it is worth our tax money to deal with it , since it 's probably going to be a minority of cases out of all of them ."," our next issue is that she has to get an answer from him within the abortion window ."," well , we kind of need to know who he is , right ?"," what if he takes off and avoids the legal process ?"," does his avoidance mean he lost his opportunity to opt out ?"," what if she just says she ca n't find him ?"," how do you prove which way it went ?"," who pays for that ?"," what if there are a few different men who could be the father ."," should we just require all of them file and yes or no paperwork , and if it ends up being another man 's kid the guy who said yes is obligated to care for that kid , even if it is not biologically his ?"," i think there are probably a lot of men out there who would want to raise * their * child , but not someone else 's ."," so i imagine a lot of people are thinking - well have a paternity test done ."," there is one paternity test available right now for unborn fetuses ."," it 's called an [ amniocentesis ] ( http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/amniocentesis ) ."," but it has side effects if you do it too early ."," most doctors wo n't do it before around the 15th week of pregnancy , though some do it as early as 11 weeks ."," even if we make the huge assumption that the man and woman would agree taking the sample at 11 weeks is worth the risk to both the baby and mother , we 've still cut our window to get this whole legal procedure done down to about 9 weeks ."," i actually do n't think that people would be able to agree on when the risks are acceptable to do this test ."," it 's the woman 's body , should she have final say ?"," what happens if she refuses to take the test until 15 weeks ?"," will the guy just have a shortened window for this ?"," what if she refuses to take it at all , as is her legal right ?"," should the guy have a way to override her medical decisions because of his need to be able to opt out financially ?"," if he does have a legal way to force this upon her , should he be liable for any injury he causes to her or the fetus ?"," what courts are we going to resolve these issues in ?"," should we have a full hearing with presentation of evidence and attorneys ?"," who pays for the test ?"," but lets go back to our best case scenario here , where the woman is cooperating , allowing tests , going to the doctor , we 've established paternity , and yet we still have a 9 week window to get this done ."," well we assume that the man , files his decision with some sort of court system along with his positive paternity test , right ?"," keep in mind current court resources and funding , which i do not think the majority of the population would support paying higher taxes to expand ."," well , the woman has to have official notice of him doing this and opting out within the abortion window , which means that she has to be served with that paperwork , just like pretty much every legal thing filed against a person ."," who pays for service ?"," what if the woman disappears to avoid service ?"," that happens all the time with other civil cases ."," the current system you can eventually serve by publication , which means putting it in a newspaper or other public place and saying they basically got it , but you have to meet strict guidelines before you get there , all of which take time ."," there is no way it would be done in 9 weeks ."," what happens in those cases ?"," what if she has a valid excuse ?"," should it be a crime for her to do this ?"," what happens to the baby if she has it because she avoided service ?"," what happens if there is a legitimate reason she disappeared , like she was kidnapped or hospitalized or something ?"," does he have to pay child support ?"," does she have to go it alone even though not getting an abortion was not her fault ?"," what court system should resolve this ?"," and finally , if everything goes right - if she cooperates , lets the dad know , goes to the doctor , if he files his intentions with whichever court we are going to use here , we have a way to fund this court or pay for extra workers in other courts to handle this caseload in a timely manner , and she makes an informed decision and has the baby , what happens if she needs help raising it ?"," what happens if she 's poor , or loses her job , or the kid gets sick and has major expenses ?"," do taxpayers now

happen ."," sometimes i 'm left to wonder if she is doing all this to try to get rid of me ."," two weeks ago , i asked her for some time to sit down and be honest with each other with an open discussion ."," i was trying to figure out whether she was frustrated with me or was it just unhappy things in her life seeping into the relationship and she was taking it out on me ."," from this discussion , we came to the conclusion that she may be unhappy with her life and she was taking it out on me ."," so here is some backstory on the issues going on with her life ."," five months ago , she lost her sales job at the mall ."," since then , she 's just been doing nothing with her life ."," she 's becoming very lazy and unmotivated ."," she has gotten very creative with finding new ways to procrastinate ."," she has no post secondary education or training in any field ."," her support group consists of friends that work dead end job and smoke marijuana all day every day ."," ( to be clear , my stance on marijuana is this : if you have your life put together , and you want to smoke marijuana recreationally , then all the power to you ."," however , if your life is not put together and you are using marijuana as a form of escape from having to face the challenges of putting your life together , then i am against the consumption of it . )"," i m simply mentioning her support group because i want to highlight the fact that she has nobody in her social circle that are motivated individuals with goals and the drive to pursue them ."," all her friends believe they will never get out of their unhappy situations and resort to drugs to make things better ."," ( to be clear , my gf has now limited her consumption of marijuana to a few times a month . )"," from our discussion , i ve learned that my gf and i have a very contrasting view on life ."," i believe that with hard work and sacrifice , people generally have the power to potentially move into a better situation ."," however , she believes that people are just stuck and they are all doomed to be miserable and there is nothing they can do to change that ."," two months ago , she attempted to pursue post secondary education but quit about a month in ."," i ve done everything i could to be supportive and encourage her ."," i ve worked with her to help improve her resume ."," she has only applied for one job since losing her job ."," i ve offered to help tutor her or go over assignments if she needed help ."," i ve forced nothing on her and have not demanded her to do anything with her life ."," however , her lack of drive , laziness , and the excuses she makes to continue her procrastination began to make her lose her appeal to me ."," from that , my effort level started dropping ."," i gave myself a deadline of mid-october to end things if she still refuses to better her life ."," she is not aware of this deadline ."," two days ago we had another argument ."," i was firm on my stance that i felt like she made a mistake this time and she was insistent that she did not ."," the next day , she cut off communication again without saying a word ."," from experience , i learned to give her time and space ."," i will admit that in the heat of the moment of finding out she cut off communication again , i unfortunately left her a passive aggressive comment that i refuse to apologize this time because i was not wrong and that she is making things worst but cutting off communication again ."," i left her alone for the rest of the day ."," yesterday night , i reached out to her to try to talk ."," i was still emotional , hurt and upset ."," i mentioned in our conversation that if she cuts off communication suddenly again by blocking me off like she usually does , then i m done with the relationship ."," she did not take kindly to this whatsoever ."," however , we continued our discussion and as we were working things out and got into why we had our initial argument , we both remained firm on our stance of who was right or wrong ."," i continued to make arguments for my stance and she reached her boiling point and broke ."," she gave an incredible sarcastic apology about being wrong ."," then she said i was always out to be right and there is no room for anything else ."," ( to be fair , she has mentioned this before ."," i have made effort to change this aspect of me and for the most part i have ."," for whatever reason , i was just adamant about my stance this time . )"," she said she does nt see us getting better and said she was done with this relationship ."," to her credit , while i ve brought up the idea of breaking up previously , she has never mentioned it until now ."," in that moment after she said all that , i realized it was a situation where i won the battle but lost the war ."," in my attempts to salvage the situation , i convinced her to give us more time and have a little faith in our relationship ."," her laziness and lack of motivation is not appealing and made me put less effort into the relationship ."," ( i feel she sensed that because during our talk last night , she said that i have nt been putting in as much effort . )"," i have full faith in her that she can break out of her slump ."," i initially created a deadline to protect myself because i ca nt wait forever ."," she has great qualities that i appreciate and learn from ."," i ve tried to be a rock for her and support her in every way that i can ."," i m not perfect and i m at fault as well ."," right now , i m lost as to what to do from here ."," i m kind of surprised that i went from thinking about breaking up with her in the future to begging her for more time ."," she turned the tables on me quick ."," we ve arranged a brief date today in the afternoon with the possibility of having dinner as well ."," could i have potentially looked too far ahead and forgot to nurture the present ?"," is this relationship worth saving ?"," if so , how should i go about making things better ?"," ( she suggested i buy her a gift to start ."," it concerns me a little because i worry that from here on out , materialistic gifts will become the sole symbols of apologies . )"],"summary":"my gf tried to end the relationship last night after i got too obsessed about winning an argument . i convinced her to give us more time . what do i do now

{"id":"train-TLDR_RS_2018-04-2228.json","document":["** edit : trackmania turbo is now free on ps + for the month !"," for those interested in a huge race , i 've set up a \" raceroyale \" server online ."," it has 100 slots and it 's in laps mode , with all the multilap tracks from white and green series ."," first one to complete 10 laps wins !"," to find it , search for lap mode , then look for \" raceroyale \" ."," so , here comes the new batch of playstation plus games , and it 's a treat for people who love cars , with mad max and trackmania turbo ."," even though most of the eyes will be turned towards the post-apocalyptic world developed by avalanche studios , trackmania turbo is definitely not to be overlooked and it could bring that dose of high - speed fun you 've probably been missing on consoles ."," so , as a long - time fan of the series , let me introduce you to trackmania turbo ."," trackmania is a long - lasting series of racing games ."," at the end of 2018 , it will be 15 years old , which makes it one of the longest racing franchises , alongside gran turismo , forza , need for speed , and mario kart ."," developed by nadeo , which is now part of ubisoft , it features a powerful map editor which allows everyone to create their own tracks ."," each trackmania game features its own environments , which all have different gameplays and styles for an infinitely replayable experience ."," trackmania is extremely community - oriented , and very quickly , websites featuring maps , skins , 3d models , movies , replays , were created ."," some of them still thrive to this day , up to the latest version of trackmania ."," currently , on pc , trackmania is included into a bigger project called maniaplanet , where the players can create their own mods ."," and if you want to play the definitive trackmania experience , you should grab the trackmania  packs on steam , they 're not that expensive ."," trackmania is also a highly competitive game ."," even if it has already past its golden age , from 2006 to 2011 , many competitions are still hosted these days , and when a popular french twitch entertainer makes its own cup , it gathers thousands of viewers online ."," he managed to fill , two years in a row , a 3,000 - seat amphitheatre for the finals ."," races are tense and thrilling , knowing that every thousandth of a second counts ."," so all that lead us where we are today ."," #what is trackmania turbo ?"," trackmania turbo was released in march 2016 ."," despite being advertised as such , it 's not the first console trackmania game : iterations of the saga , developed by subsidiary studios , were released on nintendo ds and wii ."," turbo was , however , the first console trackmania game to be developed by nadeo , and the first one to get released on playstation and xbox platforms ."," it features all 4 environments of trackmania  on pc : ** canyon , valley , lagoon and stadium ** ."," each one has its own way to play , and each one has its tricks to be mastered ."," you 'll need to adapt and learn to become the best pilot of the pack ."," the game plays in a rock - solid 60 fps in 1080p , and you 're in a treat if you own a ps4 pro , because it offers better visuals and resolution , still at 60 fps ."," in trackmania , there 's no ai , no collisions with opponents - it 's all ** you against time ** ."," the pure essence of time attack , trying to grab second after second , then hundredth after hundredth ."," each track features checkpoints - you 'll need to cross them all in order to finish ."," if you miss one , you 'll just go through the finish line but nothing will happen ."," in case you mess up , you can respawn at the last checkpoint you 've crossed , and you can also restart the whole track by a single press of a button ."," you 'll still need to wait for the reglementary 3 -2-1 countdown before starting ."," in terms of gameplay , canyon would be closer to ridge racer ."," the car weight is quite heavy , but it can go really fast and can drift over really long distances ."," circuits can span over large platforms , very long jumps but also on narrow and bumpy roads ."," taking place in a large american desert , canyon will put your daring and drifting skills to the test ."," valley is closer to wrc games - noticeably slower than all three environments , you 'll have to navigate through narrow dirt trails on forest , but also larger roads and maybe some platforms ."," valley is all about precision - the car direction is very sensitive and you can drift very easily , making you lose a precious amount of time ."," lagoon is really a gameplay on its own and can resemble f - zero ."," basically , the car has a 11\/10 handling ."," it 'll handle sharp turns in a blink of an eye , may it be on classic roads , or tortuous magnet roller - coaster roads ."," but beware : once it goes off these roads , like on beaches and wooden platforms , the lagoon car becomes really hard to handle ."," being blazing fast , lagoon will test your reflexes on each track - how fast will you be able to react ?"," this is the competitive environment , adopted by professional players on pc ."," featuring a formula 1 on steroids , it has a very precise gameplay that is definitely unique ."," and if trajectories are key , you 'll need to learn tricks like drifting to take sharp turns faster than simply just releasing the gas ."," stadium features many driving secrets and even more than 10 years after its inception in the trackmania series , people still find new tricks to go even faster ."," the solo mode features ** 200 tracks , 50 per environment ** ."," they are divided into five different series , each one increasing in difficulty : ** white , green , blue , red , and black ** ."," white and green tracks are quite easy to handle for newcomers , but starting from blue series , you 'll need to keep your focus more and more - the red and black tracks being truly excruciating to even finish , filled with obstacles , series of turns and unfair elements that makes the game a true \" dark souls of racing \" ."," you 'll need to obtain medals to advance in the solo campaign : ** bronze , silver , and gold ** ."," you 'll need all 200 gold medals if you want to get the platinum trophy ."," but , there 's a twist : the gold medal is n't the best one ."," if you manage to beat the time set by the creator of the map , you 'll obtain a green medal , called the ** trackmaster medal ** ."," and you 'll need to bag 50 of them to get the platinum trophy ."," but you can go much farther away , and to talk about that , i 'll need to open the spoilers tag ."," [ spoiler ] ( # s \" if you manage to get all 200 trackmaster medals , the journey is far from being over ."," a new mode , called super solo , is unlocked ."," it 's the same tracks you have just \" mastered \" , but this time , the super trackmaster medal was n't set by the developers - but by actual professional trackmania players ."," beating even one of these times proves you are part of the very best trackmania players in the world ."," and there 's just an handful of players that managed to beat all 200 super trackmaster medals , including the very players who set these times ."," also , despite the game not featuring a detailed leaderboard for each track , you 'll know where is your place in that leaderboard after setting up your time ."," also , the game makes separate leaderboards per country , region and subregion ."," so if you ca n't be the best in the world , try to be the best where you live ."," and if it can help , if your friends set up better times than you , you can challenge their ghosts to see what they did , and try to do better to beat them ."," you can play trackmania turbo in split - screen with up to four players on various modes , that you 'll be free to discover and enjoy ."," but there is one mode that is quite unique and interesting : ** double driver ** ."," in that mode , both players control the same car , and the game will average your inputs ."," so if you turn left , and your partner turns right , the car will go straight ."," you 'll need to coordinate your moves to beat the best times ."," this is a very interesting mode and you 'll definitely have fun while playing it ."," while featuring only 1 % of the multiplayer experience on pc with maniaplanet , trackmania turbo offers all drivers to play on dedicated servers on three different modes : ** time attack , rounds , and laps ** ."," as trackmania wants to offer the most pure driving experience possible , there are n't any collisions between the players - so there wo n't be any griefers trying to ruin your race ."," so you 'll be able to focus on your trajectories and your precision ."," - ** time attack ** is simple : before the timer runs out , you 'll have to set the fastest time ."," the clock is ticking , so you 'll have to adapt fast and rely on your skills to be the best ."," or , if you practiced the track already , you can get the upper hand ."," but beware , some players can adapt very quickly and set times in minutes , while you could n't beat them even if you spent hours ."," i know that kind of feeling ."," - ** rounds ** is the pure racing experience : everybody starts at the same time , and the first one to cross the finish line gets the most points ."," the first to reach the point limit gets the victory , like in any championship ."," - ** laps ** is the same thing as rounds , but on a track where the start and finish is the same ( so basically like any other circuit in real life - while rounds mode is a point a  point b race ) ."," the race takes place over several laps ."," here , no point system , 1st one to cross the finish line wins it all ."," if you want to scratch that \" endurance \" itch , you 'll find it here ."," a nice thing is anyone can create his own server , free of charge , and set up his own rules from a pre-defined set ."," and he can put all the tracks he wants - from campaign tracks , to his own tracks , to his favourite user - created tracks he played online ."," oh , and guess what : the servers can support up to ** 100 players ** ."," so if you 're searching a battle royale racing style , it 's already here ."," trackmania would n't be trackmania without its map editor ."," it kinda works like a lego set : each piece is a block , that you can connect with others to create a track ."," then , the only limit , besides the \" technical asset limit \" , is your imagination ."," there 's a basic editor to learn , and an advanced editor if you want to go deeper ."," and for fun , the game also proposes you to generate tracks on the fly ."," you can then upload these tracks online , so people can play them in solo mode , or on your own servers in multiplayer ."," and in multiplayer mode , you can find other players ' tracks ."," the soundtrack features more than 40 music compositions from various electronic , house , d & b and techno artists ."," but their musics come with a twist : each time you crash , the music stops ."," when you go through a checkpoint , another part of the music comes up ."," if you run on specific blocks , another part of the music will come up ."," that 's quite an innovative way to play with sounds in this game , giving it a real arcade feeling ."," or you know , you can just run spotify ."," trackmania turbo also features a set of 40 brand new tracks for vr users ."," even though the full game ca n't be played in vr , and multiplayer is out of the question , these vr tracks are tailored to turn your head around and make you feel a real sense of speed , and that 's quite impressive - and it 's an even smoother experience on the pro ."," even though , i 'll admit , wipeout omega collection truly kicked it out of the park recently ."," trackmania turbo is a complete package , on a genre that 's quite missing on console these days ."," realistic driving games , like driveclub or gran turismo , definitely have their place this generation , but the true arcade genre was still missing , and i think trackmania turbo was a bit overlooked when it released in march 2016 ."," and even though the ps + release wo n't bring a long lifespan to a game the developers never intended to support in the long term - focusing their efforts on maniaplanet on pc - this is a game that should be played by the biggest amount of players ."," because it has that spark of fun that only a few games have ."," anybody can pick it up , set their own objective , and try to beat it ."," it 's infinitely replayable and makes you come back for more ."," also , this game does n't want more money than you already spent ."," there 's no micro-transactions , and all skins and stickers can solely be unlocked through playing ."," and now , it 's free for everyone - and let 's hope that a new community can give the

feels nervous \/ pressured ) ."," as for transparency , that can be very difficult ."," not all decisions will have 100 % support from all of the officers ( or yourself ) , but understand that that 's okay ."," another example that is difficult to deal with would be kicking \/ demoting someone ."," give the general concerns \/ issues that you and the officers had with that person and why you came to the decision that it was better to remove or demote them ."," * accept * the feedback ( positive or negative ) and move on !"," clearly state how you want your guild bank to run \/ work ."," people get very funny when gold \/ items \/ food \/ flasks are involved so * clearly state * who is getting what , who you require to ( or if you do n't require but would be very happy and open to receiving ) give mats \/ gold , and make sure this is pinned somewhere ( discord , forums \/ website , etc. ) so everyone can refer back to it any time they need to ."," find people with good attitudes ( * who might have bad numbers * ) , over people with bad attitudes but good numbers ."," this one will probably be the most important but requires a lot of work as a leader and can lead to people being frustrated ."," find people who share a general view of what you 're looking for and gel well with your guild \/ team that is already established ."," ** you do n't want a toxic environment ."," ** again , this game is supposed to be * fun * ."," this does not mean you wo n't be a \" progression \" guild \/ team ."," this just means it will take more time and effort from your players who have both qualities ( good attitude and good numbers ) to help with grooming the people who struggle a little bit ."," there are things you can do , such as * making a list of all the class discords * so that people can easily find access to information about their class from some of the best players ."," * compile a list of people 's specs \/ classes that have both qualities * ( ** and also check with those players that they actually do want to help , because it 's okay if they do n't want to \/ do n't feel comfortable ** ) and pin this somewhere so people can have easy access to it ."," * require each run to have logs * so you can really break down what 's happening and how to help ."," keep communications clear during events ( unless it 's a fun event ; which should be stated on it 's sign - up \/ information sheet ) ."," this will help keep frustration and any possible toxic behavior \/ reactions to a minimum ( or not have any at all ! )"," establish clear leaders ahead of time ( you probably should n't have more than 3 ) and everyone will eventually get used to their voices and trust them ."," there are many mechanics and things to call out so you can always ask extra players ahead of time ( preferably in pm so that they do n't feel pressured to do it if they do n't want to ) to help call something out if it 's becoming too much for the established leaders ."," ** the only people that should be calling things out \/ making decisions on battle rezs \/ wipes \/ etc. should be the established raid leaders , anyone that is asked to call things out as well , and healers ( to rotate healing cds \/ give information ) ."," do n't call people out for mistakes ."," no one wants to raid with some form of anxiety for making mistakes ."," and no one should be okay with calling someone out for being * \" bad \" * ."," ** everyone makes mistakes ."," ** some may be due to making a stupid mistake that you do n't normally do ."," maybe it was due to the strategy changing ."," maybe it was due to something about a mechanic that you just did n't know ."," * pm the person instead and listen to them , do n't be condescending or embarrass them about it ."," it 's okay to not progress all the time ."," things take time , real life happens , people leave which make things hard ."," if you 're raiding and things are n't going well , * take a 10 minute break * for people to get a drink , food , take a deep breath , use the bathroom ."," you will lose 10 minutes of raid time , but it will be worth it in the end when everyone comes back with a clearer head ."," * keep your morale up with your guild \/ team because things are never perfect ."," * if you do n't kill a boss , tell everyone that you 'll get it next time ."," use this time to critically reflect your logs and strategies ."," think about what you can change to make it cleaner ."," these are only a few tips and tricks i 've learned while being an officer in many communities on many games ."," each guild is

other than what she may \/ may not have told him ."," and they started dating after we were already very low contact ."," he is basically a stranger ."," we do not know him at all - whether he is an enabler or a passing guest in her life ."," and we both find it extremely offensive and inappropriate that he left an authoritative , chastising message for a 35 year old man that he barely knows ."," my fianc then explained to me that he is concerned that all the hard work we have established over many years may be destroyed ; creating boundaries and keeping low contact is going to come crumbling around us ."," this man overtly disapproves of the low contact situation ."," he made that abundantly clear in this message ."," and my fianc is worried that this will only lead to enabling ."," or , as he said it , \" putting a bug in my mom 's ear that this is n't \" right \" and i should n't be treating her this way . \""," which is the only ammunition she will need to start harassing him , me and my family again ."," that very minor prodding will open floodgates tantamount to the elevator scene in the shining ."," my fianc is not a worrier - that is my job in the relationship :)"," the fact he is concerned at all is a huge red flag of the reality this may happen ."," he is usually never wrong about situations like this ."," we 're not sure how , exactly to handle this moving forward

remains a stranger to us ."," it is unanimous that my fianc is not in any way obligated to disclose the reason for the nature of the low contact relationship - nor does he want to ."," we also know very little of the picture she has painted of him ."," we may be reading this completely wrong ."," but , we both feel that now we have to establish boundaries with this guy ."," and that 's something that needs to be handled with a phone call back to him ."," but , with nondisclosure , keeping things short and to the point - how do we do this ?"," what can my fianc say to make it clear there is a

my family \" and heads out ."," this past friday night we met at a local food place and ate and then she came over and we and hung out until like 1 or 2 am again ."," we still just talk and laugh and hang out ."," at one point she asks for a hand massage , which i gave her , and we kept talking ."," she came over again last night for a few hours and then took off ."," this is basically how it 's been , she 'd come over a few hours , typically at night , and we 'll talk and laugh and eat food and stuff , and she leaves ."," the complications set in because of the fact she has a boyfriend ."," after becoming aware of this fact , i ensure i 'm not trying to send flirtatious signals or anything , as i do n't want to complicate her relationship or cause turmoil inside her ."," simply hanging out and being friends is cool with me , but i would n't be opposed ( if she was n't in a relationship ) to becoming something more than friends ."," hearing her talk about her relationship , basically she 's bored as all hell ."," she does n't have female friends because all of them end up just using her and \/ or causing way too much drama ."," she 's not allowed to have guy friends , per her boyfriend ."," so this means she talks to me behind his back , through fb ."," her plans involve wanting a new job and wanting to travel and things like that ."," her bf does n't want her to leave , and wants to remain with her in our current city ."," he 's holding her here essentially , but she says she loves him and does n't want to break up with him to pursue something else , that something else not work out , and her end up regretting breaking up with him ."," she tells me her bf is so boring and does n't do anything ."," she 'll suggest going places and doing things but he never does or wants to ."," the times she just says screw it and decides to do something anyways ( like see a movie or something without him ) , then he 'll get all involved and say he wants to go with her and stuff ."," because he never wanted to go until she was going to go without him ."," so in my current situation , she 's apparently bored \/ frustrated \/ tired of her current bf , but still loves him and does n't want to break up ."," in the meantime , she talks to me behind his back , comes over to my house , usually late at night , and we talk and stuff ."," the fact that she comes over so late , randomly stops by , and came over just to give me the pumpkin bread really confuses me ."," are these supposed to be signals ?"," i feel like i 'm subconsciously blocking the perception of these signals , because of the fact that she 's in a relationship , and i do n't want to compromise that ."," how do i go about this situation ?"," the whole \" if she monkeyswings in , she 'll monkeyswing out \" and \" if she 'll cheat with you , she 'll cheat on you \" are definitely scary prospects and i would n't want that to be the case with us ."," ( meaning , i do n't want her to chase somethign with me while she has a boyfriend ."," however , i also do n't want to try and \" break her up \" with him )"," is this something that normally happens ?"," am i overreacting \/ overanalyzing ?"," should her actions make me run away in fear ?"," any sort of interpretation would be greatly appreciated , especially from anyone that 's older \/ been through this ( from either side ) ."," i apologize for such a long post , i feel like i 'm getting all of this off my chest in a way , so i just kept typing ."," i 'll happily explain anything further , or answer any questions ."," thanks
