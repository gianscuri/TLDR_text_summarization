roughly a week ago , that she no longer wants to be with me and needs time to herself to figure out if she wants me or not ."," to give a little back story of our history , we were n't allowed to move in together until we were married because of her mother , her mother * hated * me and even called the police on me once because she saw on the news that some guy poisoned her wife and thought that i must be doing that as well , that 's not a joke , that 's seriously what happened and my bloody heart races from anxiety whenever i see her now ."," anyways , her mother would also give her daughter ( my wife ) grief as well about made up stories and this had been going on for years ."," as soon as we got married , my wife filed for disability , claiming that she had hurt her back , at first i was understanding and caring of this , however after a while she did n't seem like she had any problem and she would go out and wear heels , i would ask if that 's something she should be doing ( wearing heels ) , given her back , this would cause arguments and she would claim i was controlling her so i stopped bringing it up , but i 'll admit it 's something i think about as her back problem does n't appear to be there anymore ( i 'm not saying it is n't ) , and she still goes out constantly but does n't work ."," the first few months into us being married were pretty rough on us both , she claimed i did n't care enough about the relationship , we had her mother calling in constantly checking on us , she would be unhappy and i would always try to talk to her but it would end up in yelling when she would yell at me first and i would lose my cool ."," she would claim i do n't do anything and she is unhappy with me , i would shoot back with that i work long hours , i stress out , i pay bills , i get home late and that although i 'm sorry if i have n't seemed caring , i 'm trying and that i love her ."," this fighting would usually end with her threatening to break my computer , throw my stuff out etc. ."," but after those few months , things settled , things were good , we were laughing again , hanging with each other , going out etc. i was still stressing about work and whatnot , but she seemed happy , and that made me happy ."," we were talking about the possibility of having a child before we hit 30 ."," fast forward to a few months ago , she started to seem distant , i would try to get involved and do things with her , but she would claim i was getting in her space and she wanted space ."," her lifestyle started to change , she was big into late night partying , taking mdma and stuff , which is ok , i 'd come to some of them but stopped after a while , as it was n't for me ."," about a few weeks ago , i found out she was beginning to throw up her food and she started cutting herself ."," she told me she felt worthless and felt like nothing , and just wanted to drink and dance ."," i told her we should go see a doctor but she kept putting it off , kept making excuses , i 'd ask her to keep her food down , stop cutting etc. but she would n't listen ."," i tried my best to try and make her happy , but she 'd go back to \" you 're in my space , leave me alone \" and she 'd go to watching movies alone , to going out with her friends without me ."," roughly a week and a half ago it came to a head when i came home , we had dinner together , and she told she would like a break , she 's no longer in love with me , there are problems with her and she feels that i 'm either to blame for most of it or all of it ."," i told her i could n't just move out , i have no where to go currently ( my parents have no room ) , she ca n't go home as her mother is crazy and would possibly call the police on me claiming im abusing her or something ."," she said that i have n't given her enough affection throughout the 10 years we 've been together , that she always felt like she was second place , that i have n't done enough for her ."," i got angry , lost my temper , claimed that i felt i 've done a lot , again i apologised if i had n't shown i was the most caring , but i worked and i worked hard for her , this place , for us etc. she got extremely angry at me when i said those things , she said that i was trying to guilt trip her into staying , that i was trying to make her feel even more worthless ."," i told her she meant everything to me and i pleaded for her to reconsider this ."," she took off her wedding ring and said she was done and that from now on , while under the same roof , we wont be talking until she figures out if she wants to be with me or not ."," she pretty much ignored me for a few days until on the weekend i agreed to pick her up from a party , i picked her up , she was really badly drunk , and she told me she loved me , and she was sorry ."," the next day she was really hungover , i helped her recover , and then that night she acted like nothing had happened and said she still wanted the break , that was this weekend ."," it 's been a week now ( besides that little incident on the weekend ) and it 's been driving me crazy , i would text her and she would n't respond , i would get home and she would act like im not there , i would go to bed and she would head out at 12 am and not tell me where she 's going , i do n't even know what time she 'd get home , i feel like i 've lost her completely and i just want her back , i just want to talk to her again , i just want her ."," i go from angry thinking that this is unfair on me , to sad and upset thinking i could have just tried

have tried mentioning couples therapy , but has said no ."," i have asked if she has been seeing anyone else , she said no , she does n't want to see anyone else , she feels she is suffering from depression and just wants space from everything ."," she came into the bedroom just before , asking if i could help her find cheap plane tickets for her and her friend , at first i agreed and i was

will admit it is something i think about as her back problem does not appear to be there anymore i am not saying it is not and she still goes out constantly but does not work","the first few months into us being married were pretty rough on us both she claimed i did not care enough about the relationship we had her mother calling in constantly checking on us she would be unhappy and i would always try to talk to her but it would end up in yelling when she would yell at me first and i would lose my cool","she would claim i do not do anything and she is unhappy with me i would shoot back with that i work long hours i stress out i pay bills i get home late and that although i am sorry if i have not seemed daring i am trying and that i love her","this fighting would usually end with her threatening to break my computer throw my stuff out etc","but after those few months things settled things were good we were laughing again hanging with each other going out etc i was still stressing about work and whatnot but she seemed happy and that made me happy","we were talking about the possibility of having a child before we hit thirty","fast forward to a few months ago she started to seem distant i would try to get involved and do things with her but she would claim i was getting in her space and she wanted space","her lifestyle started to change she was big into late night parting taking idea and stuff which is ok i would come to some of them but stopped after a while as it was not for me","about a few weeks ago i found out she was beginning to throw up her food and she started cutting herself","she told me she felt worthless and felt like nothing and just wanted to drink and dance","i told her we should go see a doctor but she kept putting it off kept making excuses i would ask her to keep her food down stop cutting etc but she would not listen","i tried my best to try and make her happy but she would go back to you are in my space leave me alone and she would go to watching moves alone to going out with her friends without me","roughly a week and a half ago it came to a head when i came home we had dinner together and she told she would like a break she is no longer in love with me there are problems with her and she feels that i am either to blame for most of it or all of it","i told her i could not just move out i have no where to go currently my parents have no room she cannot go home as her mother is crazy and would possibly call the police on me claiming i am abusing her or something","she said that i have not given her enough affection throughout the ten years we have been together that she always felt like she was second place that i have not done enough for her","i got angry lost my temper claimed that i felt i have done a lot again i apologise if i had not shown i was the most daring but i worked and i worked hard for her this place for us etc she got extremely angry at me when i said those things she said that i was trying to guilt trip her into staying that i was trying to make her feel even more worthless","i told her she meant everything to me and i pleaded for her to reconsider this","she took off her wedding ring and said she was done and that from now on while under the same roof we will not be talking until she figures out if she wants to be with me or not","she pretty much ignored me for a few days until on the weekend i agreed to pick her up from a party i picked her up she was really badly drunk and she told me she loved me and she was sorry","the next day she was really hunger i helped her recover and then that night she acted like nothing had happened and said she still wanted the break that was this weekend","it is been a week now besides that little incident on the weekend and it is been driving me crazy i would text her and she would not respond i would get home and she would act like i am not there i would go to bed and she would head out at twelve am and not tell me where she is going i do not even know what time she would get home i feel like i have lost her completely and i just want her back i just want to talk to her again i just want her","i go from angry thinking that this is unfair on me to sad and upset thinking i could have just tried to show her more affection or anything to keep her","i do not want to lose her and i feel like and idiot begging her but i have no idea what to do","i feel like an emotional wreck","i have tried mentioning couples therapy but has said no","i have asked if she has been seeing anyone else she said no she does not want to see anyone else she feels she is suffering from depression and just wants space from everything","she came into the bedroom just before asking if i could help her find cheap plane tickets for her and her friend at first i agreed and i was starting to do it but then i stopped and i tried to kiss her she backed away started yelling walked out","again i feel sore i feel angry and used but i also feel sad and alone i feel like i need her and i would try to do anything to get her back","she says it is too late","i am really sorry for the huge wall of text and for any spelling mistakes but i felt like this was almost cathartic to write it out","i just do not know what to do i do not know if i should let this break happen i guess i need advice on how to approach this as i feel drained"],"document_tokenized":[["hello","relationships","i","did","not","really","know","where","else","to","post","this","but","i","am","writing","this","hoping","to","get","an","outsiders","perspective","as","i","feel","like","i","am","going","crazy"],["i","am","sorry","if","i","covered","too","much","i","felt","like","it","was","best","to","cover","important","points","as","these","are","pretty","much","the","points","that","are","almost","always","brought","up","when","we","argue"],["i","have","been","with","my","wife","for","roughly","ten","years","now","married","for","two","we","have","been","through","a","lot","together","but","i","love","her","just","as","much","as","i","do","when","we","first","started","dating"],["she","has","told","me","roughly","a","week","ago","that","she","no","longer","wants","to","be","with","me","and","needs","time","to","herself","to","figure","out","if","she","wants","me","or","not"],["to","give","a","little","back","story","of","our","history","we","were","not","allowed","to","move","in","together","until","we","were","married","because","of","her","mother","her","mother","hated","me","and","even","called","the","police","on","me","once","because","she","saw","on","the","news","that","some","guy","poisoned","her","wife","and","thought","that","i","must","be","doing","that","as","well","that","is","not","a","joke","that","is","seriously","what","happened","and","my","bloody","heart","races","from","anxiety","whenever","i","see","her","now"],["anyway","her","mother","would","also","give","her","daughter","my","wife","grief","as","well","about","made","up","stories","and","this","had","been","going","on","for","years"],["as","soon","as","we","got","married","my","wife","filed","for","disability","claiming","that","she","had","hurt","her","back","at","first","i","was","understanding","and","daring","of","this","however","after","a","while","she","did","not","seem","like","she","had","any","problem","and","she","would","go","out","and","wear","heels","i","would","ask","if","that","is","something","she","should","be","doing","wearing","heels","given","her","back","this","would","cause","arguments","and","she","would","claim","i","was","controlling","her","so","i","stopped","bringing","it","up","but","i","will","admit","it","is","something","i","think","about","as","her","back","problem","does","not","appear","to","be","there","anymore","i","am","not","saying","it","is","not","and","she","still","goes","out","constantly","but","does","not","work"],["the","first","few","months","into","us","being","married","were","pretty","rough","on","us","both","she","claimed","i","did","not","care","enough","about","the","relationship","we","had","her","mother","calling","in","constantly","checking","on","us","she","would","be","unhappy","and","i","would","always","try","to","talk","to","her","but","it","would","end","up","in","yelling","when","she","would","yell","at","me","first","and","i","would","lose","my","cool"],["she","would","claim","i","do","not","do","anything","and","she","is","unhappy","with","me","i","would","shoot","back","with","that","i","work","long","hours","i","stress","out","i","pay","bills","i","get","home","late","and","that","although","i","am","sorry","if","i","have","not","seemed","daring","i","am","trying","and","that","i","love","her"],["this","fighting","would","usually","end","with","her","threatening","to","break","my","computer","throw","my","stuff","out","etc"],["but","after","those","few","months","things","settled","things","were","good","we","were","laughing","again","hanging","with","each","other","going","out","etc","i","was","still","stressing","about","work","and","whatnot","but","she","seemed","happy","and","that","made","me","happy"],["we","were","talking","about","the","possibility","of","having","a","child","before","we","hit","thirty"],["fast","forward","to","a","few","months","ago","she","started","to","seem","distant","i","would","try","to","get","involved","and","do","things","with","her","but","she","would","claim","i","was","getting","in","her","space","and","she","wanted","space"],["her","lifestyle","started","to","change","she","was","big","into","late","night","parting","taking","idea","and","stuff","which","is","ok","i","would","come","to","some","of","them","but","stopped","after","a","while","as","it","was","not","for","me"],["about","a","few","weeks","ago","i","found","out","she","was","beginning","to","throw","up","her","food","and","she","started","cutting","herself"],["she","told","me","she","felt","worthless","and","felt","like","nothing","and","just","wanted","to","drink","and","dance"],["i","told","her","we","should","go","see","a","doctor","but","she","kept","putting","it","off","kept","making","excuses","i","would","ask","her","to","keep","her","food","down","stop","cutting","etc","but","she","would","not","listen"],["i","tried","my","best","to","try","and","make","her","happy","but","she","would","go","back","to","you","are"

looking at my moss water bill and realized that we are using almost ten times more water this year than from the same time last year","i moved out a few months ago but i saw that last month my mon and brother used gallows in water consumption and gallows in wastewater","our average neighborhood water consumption is only gallows and average for the city is","the graph shows a steady rise from last july till now jumping from using six times less than the average in our neighborhood to now we are using about three times more","with one less person at the house","also my mon said that last month they barely even did sundry and did it water the grass","flash forward to tonight at a m when i m in bed thinking about the water bill","i go to the roof just to check if i could hear any water running and sure enough i hear water going full blast","i crawl across the roof and look over the ledge and see that the neighbors have created an entire irrigation system with put pipes that water these four trees planted inside of a make shift garden in the middle of the yard","i decide to go downstairs to check it out but my shoes kept crunching under the leaves so by the time i got to the fence the water was off","i smelled smoke in the air that was it weed or cigarettes and can only assume that is what met smoke smells like","it s strange because the only people who live at that house are an elderly man and his wife who are both in their s","we recently saw an ambulance pick someone up at that house unfortunately","also last year the son set up security camera facing our house specifically","this family is known to trap the neighborhood cats and call animal control to pick them up even though our neighborhood purposely released them there","i checked all the horses and they were all off but when i went to check on the river where the fence divides us i noticed the same put pipes from the irrigation system spread around next to this white thick pipe in the ground","perhaps a senate pipe","there s also this weird dog house shaped thing that might be covering some water system that s behind our she would","it was there when we moved in ten years ago and we have it really checked what it is since we do it go back there and the she would is blocking the view","i m checking it out closer in the morning","lastly there is also a long silver stick spot in the middle of our backward that has a wheel to turn like all the other horses","my heart is beating so fast because i m not sure what we could do now since we did it call the police from the first time we saw them in our yard","how can i find out if they ve been breaking into our backward to steal water","is there anything we can do to check if they re legally allowed to be there","should we contact the police","i m scared they might be unstable since i smelled the met earlier tonight","thank you so much for reading this and for any advice you might

lately is go to have a few bees or stay at home and have a few bees","cannot we do something new that does not involve beer","i guess he got annoyed that i was not thrilled to be going to a bar and said something like this should not be so difficult it should be more natural","i just want some fresh air this is the normal thing to do on a saturday afternoon","it excavated to him saying you want to just stay home","and also at one point said what you want to schedule sex now","want to make a sex schedule","it should happen naturally not like sex now boom boom and i did not respond to that because i did not want to have an argument about sex since we have never had that kind of argument before and it could just make things awkward","so now i am sitting home alone and he is out at a bar drinking a beer alone during our literally only free time together for the next week","i understand that he is free to do what he wants and he is never obliged to have sex with me","that is not even the issue here i was absolutely willing and happy to go out and do something just not sit at a bar","i feel like he is not willing to compromise with me and find something we both want to do","i felt like he was saying he is going to do exactly what he wants to do and i can take it or leave it","i understand the need for fresh air but this is our only opportunity for alone time in two weeks","is not that important too","should not we be able to compromise","i e we go to a bar and have one drink and then we go to a park movie museum

get the causes on your hands work and exposure","your issues are yours and i will not touch the self loathing part but what i can tell you about being easily offended i have known a lot of people who are opposite of my personality","it keeps me on my toes","these people many of them friends had strong outdoing personalities unlike mine","they also happen to be some very honest sometimes brutally honest people but they have good hearts","find someone unlike yourself who is respectfully honest with you and you can surprise yourself","i listen to a lot of stand up comedy","all good comedy is honest and all great comedy is controversial","both of these will temper your sense of humor if you invest the effort to listen without judgment and find the humor in things","some of it is lighthearted and easy to digest some of it is genuinely a challenge","none of it will do you wrong in my opinion but if you want some harsher more challenging material try daniel toss s two albums
